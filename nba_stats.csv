Yes, 39! Even though he still somehow averaged 26/8/6 in 2022-23, Father Time is starting to chip away at the legend. LeBron hit just 32% from deep and continues to settle for a lot of bad looks, attempting 6.9 per game. And for the first time in his 20-year career, LeBron averaged less than a steal per game. 

He did have a 33% usage rate which ranked 6th in the NBA, and considering the makeup of the roster, I’d guess another season above 30% is highly likely. The biggest concern outside of his average FT% on high volume and declining defensive metrics is obviously his durability, as James has been on basically every injury report the Lakers have released for the past three seasons along with Anthony Davis. The foot injury he was fighting through at the end of the season was particularly worrying. With an average of 55 games played over the past five seasons, James is as likely to play 60+ games as he is to get past the first page of a book. 

Even though the cracks in his armor are starting to show, it’s worth noting that he still managed a second-round finish in 9-cat for per-game value. If you’re willing to punt away one or two of his weaknesses, James can still get the job done and can get you 25/5/5 in his sleep.",He'll have to retire at some point in his 50s.,SF4/PF4,0,32,85,10,16,,32,0.614393147,0.290787683,18,110,413,64,11,40,19,112,96,535,32,25,42,58,43,52,25,32,21,SF8/PF11,46.287,12,49.96,8

High assists will keep his value afloat.","After 17 consecutive seasons ranked as a second-rounder or higher in 9-cat, Paul finally had a third-round finish in 2022-23, narrowly beating his ADP of 36. He played less than 70 games for the fifth time in his last seven seasons with a total of 59 appearances, and he suffered yet another injury to cut his postseason short. 

With the Suns moving in a new direction, Paul was shipped off to the Warriors where he will team up with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. Paul’s role isn’t entirely clear yet, but whether he starts or not, coach Steve Kerr said he wants CP3 to “control the game at key times” for Golden State and that he’ll spend a lot of time next to Steph. That’s all I need to hear and it’s a guarantee that his floor will likely be 28 minutes a night. 

Paul’s usage likely won’t be as high in Golden State, but Jordan Poole managed six pick-and-rolls per game last season and it’s conceivable that Paul will get roughly the same. His 2.4% steal rate is a drop off from his career rate of 3.1%, but it’s not bad either. His assist rate is still elite, and we’re likely to see some positive regression with his mid-range game which wasn’t up to his usual standards last season. If he can stay healthy and flirt with 70 games, I actually think he could end up being a good value. ",I'm expecting a 28-minute role.

","Kyle Lowry may be the latest victim of Father Time, as his production trailed off significantly for the third straight season in which he played in just 55 games. A nagging knee injury and the emergence of Gabe Vincent reduced Lowry’s role at the end of the season, leaving him outside the top-100 in 9-cat on a per-game basis. 

So where do we go from here? Lowry’s entering the final year of his contract in his age-37 season, so he’s sure to be the subject of countless trade rumors. His main competition in Vincent is now with the Lakers, while the addition of Josh Richardson will fill the hole left by Max Strus. But we also have the Damian Lillard rumors that aren’t going anywhere, making it difficult to gauge where Lowry stands with the Heat. His best days are far behind him and he’s mainly just a low-end source of dimes, 3s and steals at the expense of your FG%.",,PG6,0,150,0,,,,150,0.419581435,-0.202964384,85,509,58,90,176,189,53,80,154,466,118,170,168,140,132,201,169,146,137,PG49,27.9705,127,26.07,148

","Injuries robbed Kevin Durant of a phenomenal season, something we’ve been saying about him quite a lot. He saw the floor only 47 times in 2022-23 to continue a depressing trend. He played 55 and 35 games in the two years prior, so he’s yet to put together a full season since his Achilles injury that kept him out for the entire 2019-20 campaign. Not great for someone turning 35 before opening night. 

He was 5th in per-game 9-cat value last season, averaging 29.1 points, 6.7 rebounds, 5.0 assists,1.4 blocks, 0.7 steals and 2.0 triples with a 56/40/92 shooting line. His trade to the Suns also had a small impact on his fantasy value, as he lost a couple shots per night and saw his assists per game drop to 3.5. 

The Suns went star chasing and basically swapped Chris Paul for Bradley Beal, so it’s inevitable that a slight decrease in usage is coming for KD. But he’s been on stacked rosters for seemingly the past decade which is something he takes a lot of heat for, but he’s never once taken a backseat to anyone. The injuries are obviously not ideal, but KD is still among the best players in the NBA and proved it last season when he became the first player in history to shoot over 55% from the field, 40% from deep and 90% from the line.",Simply cannot stay on the court for the last four seasons.

Aging like a fine wine. ","Al Horford continues to age gracefully and has been able to hold his own down low with his old man strength. He made 63 appearances in 2022-23 with some maintenance days sprinkled in, but he played 30.5 minutes per night with Robert Williams limited to 35 appearances. He was able to beat his ADP of 83 as the 63rd best player in 9-cat, but he was 85th in totals. 

Now going into his age-37 season, the Celtics are likely to load manage him again. Presumably, Robert Williams will be ready for a larger workload with a healthy offseason under his best, and the addition of Kristaps Porzingis will take some of the load off Horford’s plate on both ends. 

Horford will still have a significant role on the Celtics, as the Celtics are extremely weak outside of their top seven rotation players. The veteran will likely be a couple rounds cheaper than he was last season and I think he’ll end up being a decent value with his newfound willingness to fire away from deep – he averaged a career-high 2.3 triples in 2022-23 and was second in the NBA in 3P%.",,PF6/C6,0,105,0,6,25,28,105,0.475063064,-0.06254839,95,284,289,68,207,76,121,313,37,178,99,109,124,66,109,97,61,143,146,PF32/C34,29.4916,110,25.12,160

","With Utah shifting towards a rebuild, Mike Conley was sent packing to the Wolves where he made an incredible impact. In 24 appearances, he averaged 14.0 points, 5.0 assists, 3.1 rebounds, 1.2 steals and 2.4 triples on a 46/42/86 shooting line. During that span, Conley was posting 6th-round value in 9-cat which is pretty remarkable for a 35-year-old. 

Only Stephen Curry outperformed Conley in corner 3P%, and for the season he ranked in the 98th percentile on pick-and-rolls. And in addition to Anthony Edwards, Rudy Gobert and Jaden McDaniels, he’ll have another weapon at his disposal in a healthy Karl-Anthony Towns. He might be a “boring” pick going into his age-36 season, but that could make him a valuable pick at his ADP for someone who will get the job done in points, 3s, dimes and steals with elite efficiency. I do expect him to get plenty of maintenance this season, though.

","Old man Brook Lopez turned back the clock in emphatic fashion in 2022-23, somehow sneaking into the second-round of 9-cat leagues as the 22nd best player. He appeared in 78 games and averaged 30.4 minutes. Despite playing 13 games due to back surgery the year before, the Bucks had no choice but to play him big minutes with minimal depth and with their three studs missing big chunks of the season, especially Middleton. This poor guy probably spent the entire offseason in an ice bath.

Now 35 and with a new two-year contract secured, I would absolutely expect the Bucks to dial back Lopez’s workload even if Giannis is hobbling to start the season. Lopez’s 6.7% block rate is also considerably higher than his career average of 4.9%, so it’s probably unfair to expect him to continue at that level. During his previous healthy season in 2020-21, Lopez ranked 85th in 9-cat and that’s closer to what I’m expecting this season.",Can we squeeze two more years out of this blocks and 3s machine?,C5,0,85,143,6,18,27,85,0.499403802,-0.001494446,96,93,362,137,118,119,324,274,7,406,96,79,85,71,81,53,54,208,99,C29,26.738,138,27.9,128

The hope here is that he has some motivation after falling off over the past few seasons. ,"James Harden’s rank could swing by a round or two in either direction depending on what happens with his situation. He’s clearly fed up with the 76ers, calling Daryl Morey a “liar” for not trading him after he picked up his player option. Heading into training camp, we’re looking at a very uncomfortable situation for both sides. 

On the purely basketball side of things, Harden is starting to show cracks in his armor, finishing outside the first round of 9-cat for the first time since 2011. He ranked 17th in per-game value, but injuries are piling up with four shortened seasons in a row. He’s no longer a No. 1 option on offense, but he’s still getting the job done on that front. He ranked in the 83rd percentile on ISOs which are his bread and butter, but he only got 6.1 possessions per game compared to his glory days in 2018-19 when he got 16.4(!). 

Harden is now a pass-first player, but he was a step slow in the pick-and-roll (57th percentile). Going into his age-34 season, Harden’s usual elite steal/block rates are fading fast, and he’s not getting to the free throw line nearly as much where he used to clean up. In fact, his 6.2 FTAs was his lowest mark since 2011-22. ",I will likely avoid at all costs.

","Shoulder and knee injuries limited Curry to 56 games in 2022-23, but missing games was a popular theme for many of the first-round picks such as Damian Lillard, James Harden, Anthony Davis and Tyrese Haliburton. However, Curry finished 6th in per-game value in 9-cat, and he was a juggernaut in the fantasy playoffs because he appeared in 18 straight games to close the season with the Warriors playing catch-up in the standings.

Despite being in his age-34 season, Curry maintained his absurd efficiency. His 49.3% shooting from the field was the second highest mark of his career, he shot a cool 42% from deep and hit over 91% of his free throws for the eight time in 14 seasons. All while averaging 29.4 points, 6.3 assists, 6.1 rebounds and 4.9 triples. 

There are some cracks in his armor though. For the first time in his career, Curry was held under a steal per game at 0.9. He has a career steal rate of 2.3%, but it plummeted down to 1.3% last season. You also have to be concerned about the durability. Even if you exclude the 2019-20 season when he played just five games, Curry is averaging 61 games in his last five seasons. Steve Kerr’s willingness to rest his guys doesn’t help his bottom line either. 

Jordan Poole was exiled from the Warriors in exchange for Chris Paul, though it’s hard to imagine a 38-year-old CP3 taking any more usage than Poole was allotted. With so many question marks around other first-round players, it’s a little easier to stomach Curry’s age, durability and declining steal rate in the middle of the first round.","Will have a maintenance plan, but Curry simply isn't slowing down on the court outside of lower steals.",PG2,0,0,26,1,,,7,0.745895302,0.66162841,32,228,5,2,9,76,30,80,154,535,7,14,24,8,4,7,5,5,6,PG4,50.7186,5,47.17,17

Grab him a round earlier if you’re punting 3s. ,"DeRozan is peaking in fantasy basketball a few years later than most would, putting together two consecutive seasons with third-round value in 9-cat with 76 games in 2021 and 74 games in 2022. He essentially matched his ADP of 31 last season, and he offset a slight decrease in scoring next to a healthy Zach LaVine with improved defensive numbers – he averaged a combined 1.6 stocks. 

Arguably the greatest mid-range shooter in the NBA, DeRozan ranked in the 97th percentile on post ups and the 88th percentile on ISOs. He has also become an elite playmaker too with at least five dimes per game over the last several years, ranking in the 89th percentile on pick-and-rolls. Going into his age-34 season, DeRozan will be returning to a similar roster and offensive setup, making him one of the easiest players to project in fantasy. He’s durable, efficient and gets the job done almost everywhere except 3s, making him a Jimmy Butler lite in fantasy.

He played in 67 games for the third time in five seasons, and that’s considered durable in today’s NBA unfortunately. He averaged 19.3 points, 7.4 assists, a career-high 5.1 rebounds, 1.2 steals, 2.4 triples and 0.4 blocks, posting a 47/38/85 shooting line. 

The Bucks didn’t make any big changes over the offseason with Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez back on new deals, and from a fantasy perspective it makes it much easier to project. Jrue turned some heads in April when he said he was serious about retiring from the NBA when his contract was over in a couple years, so just keep that in mind if you’re in a dynasty league. 

As far as 2023-24 goes, the biggest areas where we could see some improvement are with his mid-range game and his steal rate. His mid-range shot dropped off by 9% compared to 2021-22, and his steal rate in 2022-23 was the lowest mark of his career. Stephen Curry named Jrue as one of the three toughest defenders he’s ever faced for a reason and I think we’ll see those defensive numbers climb back up, just not to the levels he spoiled us with in the past. Jrue is still an elite fantasy point guard and is likely to be available at an affordable ADP since his best days are behind him at age 33.

His body has completely failed him with 52 or less games in four straight seasons. He’s going into his age-33 season and the Hornets should probably do him a solid and bring him off the bench as a playmaker for the second unit. 

Charlotte will be deeper this season with the addition of Brandon Miller, while Miles Bridges will be returning from suspension.

That’s right. 47. His 56 games in 2022-23 were actually his best mark of the four.

George’s usage rate was down by 6% last season with Kawhi “healthy,” and the late addition of Russell Westbrook didn’t help either. With the Clippers returning their core for next season, that isn’t likely to change. George is heading into his age-33 season, so I’m also worried that his 2.1% steal rate from last season will become the new norm –his career steal percentage is 2.5%. 

George has been a second-round per-game value in 9-cat in all four seasons he’s been with the Clippers, but unless you’re in a fantasy draft with Brandon Miller who will obviously take George No. 1, I wouldn’t roll the dice on George until Round 3 due to his age and injury history.",A second-round producer who has had some of the worst injury luck in recent memory.,SG4/SFPF4,0,31,63,10,17,,31,0.618248872,0.300884913,33,475,24,35,35,76,53,5,154,535,21,48,53,41,29,39,67,24,20,SG11,39.8703,34,41.77,34

Has been a first-round per-game value in five straight years. ","Love him or hate him, Kyrie has been consistently churning out first-round fantasy value in 9-cat. In fact, he’s done it five years in a row (per-game basis). He has also missed a ton of games for a variety of reasons, but in 2022-23 he looked very fresh on his way to 27.1 points, 5.1 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 3.1 triples, 1.1 steals and 0.6 blocks on a 51/39/94 shooting line in 60 appearances. He was 9th in per-game value and 13th in totals, making him a great buy at his ADP of 17. 

Going into his age-31 season, there’s still so much to like. Although the Mavs failed to reach the playoffs despite their best efforts (wink, wink), Kyrie was actually a terrific fit next to Luka and his stats actually went up despite playing next to the second highest-usage player in the NBA. Kyrie thrives on and off the ball, and last season he ranked in the 99th percentile for pick-and-roll ball handling and was the most efficient high volume ISO scorer (h/t NBA University). His year-to-year stats have been incredibly consistent, so if he manages to stay north of 60 games it’s hard to imagine him not living up to his projected second-round ADP.

Jaxson Hayes was not a threat, but Valanciunas lost some run to Larry Nance Jr. and only played 24 minutes a night. That’s about a six minute drop compared to 2021-22. With an ADP of 54, Valanciunas was a major bust and finished as a 10th-rounder in 9-cat.

His production in points and rebounds were stellar with Valancinuas leading the NBA in total rebound rate and scoring 20 points per 36 minutes. However, his defense tanked. In fact, Basketball Index graded him as having the 5th worst defensive dropoff compared to 2021-22. His block rate was pathetic for the second year in a row, and he posted the lowest steal rate of his career.

Valanciunas is trending down going into his age-31 season, and now he has to deal with the return of Zion. There are enough red flags here to push Valanciunas down draft boards, but he could still be a very serviceable mid-to-late round big if you can make up for his lack of block and steals elsewhere because his shooting percentages will always keep his value afloat.",Fell off a cliff in 2022-23.

","Completely healthy for the first time in a few years, Klay got his groove back and averaged a career-high 4.4 triples (2nd only to Curry) on a 41% clip. The Warriors rested him sporadically, but the fact that he played 69 games and averaged 33 minutes a night considering the circumstances (knee and Achilles issues) is pretty surprising. 

Klay ranked 64th in 9-cat per-game value which was his second lowest finish ever, finishing just below his 2022 ADP. Even though his production in points and 3s was elite, Klay had mediocre steal/block rates compared to years past, and his mid-range game disappeared – he shot 37% compared to his career average of 43%. Hopefully we’ll see some positive regression there, and the addition of Chris Paul and departure of Jordan Poole may generate some easier looks for Klay and Steph. Klay was the 6th most heavily contested 3-point shooter and still hit an absurd 41%, so imagine what he’ll be able to do now. 

Klay is one of the greatest shooters in NBA history and his name carries a ton of weight in fantasy drafts for that reason, so his ADP is unlikely to be too desirable for a player that doesn’t have a complete stat set.

Give me someone worse who will actually play more than 60 games. ,"Kawhi missed the entire 2021-22 season with an ACL tear and stumbled out of the gate in 2022-23 with low workloads and a pile of DNPs after appearing in the opener. He did ramp up nicely after the turn of the calendar year, and he ended up making 52 regular season appearances before tearing his MCL in the first playoff game. He was 13th in 9-cat per-game value, but only getting a half season out of someone with an ADP of 25 obviously wasn’t ideal. 

Heading into his age-32 season, there are even more red flags for Kawhi because he underwent a clean-up procedure on his right knee in early June, and while the Clippers insist he’ll be ready for the start of the season, you’d be foolish to call that a certainty. As for his supporting cast, Kawhi will be returning to a similar roster but it’s no secret that the Clippers are making a push for James Harden to take some of the burden off Kawhi and Paul George. 

Another concern is that Kawhi posted his lowest steal rate of his career at 2% last season, and his assist rate dropped by 5%. He’s still remarkably efficient and easy to build around, but the missed games and fragile knees will give me pause unless his ADP is properly discounted unlike 2022-23.","If you're only expecting 50 games out of him, this is the range you can take the risk.",SG4/SF4,0,41,75,9,10,,41,0.604310682,0.264520804,48,76,22,137,67,80,99,33,120,458,38,56,37,33,30,33,51,33,46,SG14/SF10,33.495,73,35.05,73

","Mr. 82 played in every single game in 2022-23, ranking 26th in 9-cat per-game value and finishing fifth overall in totals due to his durability. He was a great return on investment with his ADP of 35, and despite a 3% drop in usage rate, his counting stats were basically identical to the year before but with better efficiency. 

Vucevic has played at least 70 games in three straight seasons, and he remains one of the most reliable players on the glass with five seasons in a row with double digit rebounds. Vucevic cleans up around the rim and shot 70% from there in 2022-23, guaranteeing a strong FG% on high volume. He also saw 66 touches per game last season despite sharing the court with LaVine and DeRozan, and we can probably pencil him in for a few dimes per night once again. 

Going into his age-33 season, Vucevic’s steal and block rates are trending down but he’s still in his prime on the offensive end. He’s easy to slot into most roster builds and you don’t have to punt anything, and historically his fantasy value is much higher than his name value which leads to him being affordable in drafts. I expect that to be the case again in 2023-24, and with Vucevic returning to a similar supporting cast, there are no red flags that come to mind.",Consistently finds ways into the early-rounds.

He had a shooting line of 50/38/87, and he only turned it over 1.2 times. Tobias is a good example of why standard 9-cat rankings can sometimes be flawed, as there’s just no shot that he was more impactful than 60 other players. That said, his ability to be a glue guy for any roster build and without any major weaknesses gave him a nice little boost. 

The 76ers could be on the verge of making some major changes, and Tobias could follow James Harden out the door with Philly eager to get his contract off the books. The nice thing about Tobias is that he can slot into a similar role almost anywhere he goes, as he’s a career 37% shooter from deep and a plus defender when he’s dialed in. He’s no spring chicken at age 31, but he’s coming off the best shooting season of his career and is as durable as it gets. No one wants to tell their friends that they have Tobias on their fantasy roster, so he’ll likely be a safe and boring pick at an affordable ADP.",Unexciting role player but he'll help across the board.,SF6/PF6,0,98,155,12,,,98,0.485202493,-0.037100358,59,125,62,121,125,98,143,146,120,320,105,119,98,84,96,90,87,86,121,SF28/PF30,28.0456,126,27.35,134

But he’ll be 34 this season and the Lillard rumors make me a bit hesitant. ,"Butler is an interesting character, often bragging about his 3 AM practices while missing countless games for rest. But after averaging 55 games played in four seasons prior to 2022-23, he managed to take the court 64 times and averaged 22.9 points, 5.9 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.8 steals, 0.3 blocks and 0.6 triples on a 54/35/85 shooting line. As an added bonus in head-to-head leagues, Butler only sat out three times after January with Miami struggling in the standings. 

He was the 10th best 9-cat player in per-game value and sixth in totals, making him an outstanding value at his ADP of 30. His shooting percentages on high volume made him super easy to build around, and his lack of triples and blocks were the only categories he underwhelmed in compared to previous years. Going into his age-34 season, Butler showed during his NBA Finals run that he’s still at his peak, and even if his steal rate which ranked third in the NBA comes down a bit, there is still a ton to like here. If we get 60+ games of Jimmy B, he should outperform his ADP yet again. The uncertainty around a possible Damian Lillard trade is the only thing giving me pause.",Lillard rumors concern me. Butler also misses a ton of games for maintenance.

Last season was the perfect storm for Bojan though, as the Pistons had zero firepower with Cade Cunnigham out of the lineup which gave the veteran the greenest of lights. Now the Pistons have a healthy Cade, a stud rookie in Ausar Thompson and a logjam in the frontcourt with Jalen Duren, Marvin Bagley, Isaiah Stewart and James Wiseman. What a mess.

","Anthony day-to-day Davis lived up to his nickname, appearing in 57 games in 2022-23. His durability concerns made him affordable in drafts with an ADP of 18, and he did manage to finish 4th in per-game 9-cat value and 14th in totals. He missed 20 games in the middle of the season with a right foot stress injury, but he finished the season on a high note and only missed two games after January. 

Davis set career-highs in FG% (56.3) and rebounds (12.5) while putting up 25.9 points, 2.6 assists, 1.1 steals and 2.0 blocks. He drastically reduced his 3-point attempts to just 1.3 per game which partly explains the bump in FG%, and he hit 40% from mid-range (up about 5% from his norm). He also hit a respectable 78.4% from the line which is just shy of his career average of 79%. His production on the offensive glass was a nice surprise, as he pulled down 3.5 ORBs per game and generated the second most 2nd chance points per 100 possessions in the NBA. 

Going into his age-30 season, it would be nice to see Davis’ shot attempts get closer to 20 with LeBron another year older. And with the Lakers thin at center, it’s a safe bet that AD will primarily play the five which is fantastic for his block and rebounding rates. Because of the injury concerns, AD is a first-round talent that you can grab comfortably in the second round. “Be greedy when others are fearful.”",Lives in the locker room but still has a few years of first-round per-game upside left.,PF3/C3,0,14,23,1,10,18,14,0.65998664,0.412426667,44,23,538,366,31,1,154,112,8,497,34,6,8,23,57,10,17,53,22,PF5/C5,42.433,19,49.66,9

Injuries have been a common occurrence for Beal over the last several years, and last season was no different with just 50 games played. He ended up falling well short of his ADP of 35, finishing just outside the top 50 in per-game value. 

There were some positives though. Beal increased his efficiency and hit a career-high 50.6% from the field, scoring 23.2 points with 5.4 assists. His playmaking has come a long way, as Beal averaged over five dimes per 36 in four of his last five seasons. He’s a 69th percentile ball-handler in the pick-and-roll, something he’ll be tasked with often in Phoenix with no true point guard on the roster. He’ll also be a solid off-ball fit next to Devin Booker and Kevin Durant too, as he hit 40% of his catch-and-shoot 3s in 2022-23. Defensively, Beal’s steal rate has been underwhelming with 0.9 thefts per game in back-to-back seasons, but he did average 0.7 blocks for the second time in his career which was a nice little surprise. He’s not going to be an elite fantasy player in Phoenix, but if he maintains his efficiency and distributes the ball well he could very easily be a top-50 player.","Best years are behind him, but he's out of tank city and can focus on playmaking with the Suns.",PG4/SG4,0,52,70,,,,52,0.565232972,0.164250362,51,87,44,113,34,166,30,112,77,515,57,69,58,75,34,79,45,48,43,PG19/SG20,37.0456,48,40.81,41

Heading into September, he’s still in a leverage battle with Portland’s front office and the NBA isn’t exactly thrilled with his trade demand. Although he’s insistent on joining Miami, the reality is that a package centered around Tyler Herro and mediocre draft picks/swaps isn’t going to get the job done. So for now, we wait. 

Dame’s 2022-23 season was nothing out of the ordinary from a statistical standpoint as the 7th best player in 9-cat, as he averaged a career-high in points (32.2) and triples (4.2), bouncing back from his injury-ravaged 2021-22 campaign. But sadly, the Blazers had some “hungry eyes” for Wembanyama and shut down Dame early, ultimately snagging Scoot Henderson instead. The writing was on the wall for Dame when he was rested in the first game after a 1.5 week All-Star break. He was done. 

Scoot is now the future in Portland, but Dame may have to stick around and mentor him for a while if a trade doesn’t surface. Every bit of this is far from ideal from a fantasy perspective. On one hand, maybe he’ll see less usage on a contender. But on the other, I sure as heck don’t want him on Portland’s tank-bound roster after the new year. I’m still taking him in the first round because he’s indisputably one of the best players in the NBA for at least a couple more years, and most of the first round has their own glaring red flags anyways. ",Just needs clarity on his future. Should age gracefully with his logo-range 3s.,PG2,0,10,25,1,,,10,0.738808942,0.639677761,8,491,1,4,4,112,14,112,222,540,3,29,19,11,3,11,4,6,8,PG6,50.435,6,49.99,7

Green’s athleticism has declined rapidly and he’s starting to look more and more like present day Boris Diaw. Green’s combined steal/block rates weren’t bad by any means, but they were the lowest marks of his career and used to be his bread and butter as a fantasy asset. 

Nowadays, his main appeal is his playmaking and rebounding. But with Chris Paul now in town, it may be hard for Green to keep his assist rate at an elite level.

","Khris Middletons’ 2022-23 season was delayed due to a knee injury and later interrupted by recurring soreness. In total, he made just 33 appearances and averaged 24 minutes a night, the lowest mark since his rookie campaign. He underwent surgery after Milwaukee’s early playoff exit to address his knee issue, and the Bucks were confident enough to extend him for three years and $102M. 

So given the circumstances, there’s no real need to evaluate his campaign too closely as he was essentially playing on one leg. In his previous four seasons, Middleton ranked 40th, 41st, 30th and 63rd in 9-cat per-game value. I would imagine that the knee issue is going to scare a lot of people away, and while I’m also concerned, we can use this to our advantage. If the injury risk is baked into his ADP, Middleton may actually turn into a really solid value pick on a Milwaukee team that won’t look much different than previous years when he was a fantasy dynamo.","Bucks still believe in him.

","CJ McCollum managed to stay healthy for the first time in a couple years and started 75 games at point guard for the Pelicans in 2022-23. His counting stats were nothing out of the ordinary, as he offset a slight dip in points with a career-high 5.7 assists. But when you consider that the Pelicans were missing Brandon Ingram for half the season and Zion for most of it, CJ should’ve ranked higher than just 85th in 9-cat (per-game value). 

His shooting percentages (mainly FG%) were ultimately his downfall, and if you pull up his FG% by different distances, he was down across the board. Could he bounce back? Of course, but now he has a healthy Ingram and Zion to contend with. On top of that, many people (including myself) are expecting a mini breakout from second-year PG Dyson Daniels, so CJ has a mountain to climb if he wants to somehow get back into the top-75. 

Basketball Index graded him as an “F” in Defensive Impact, and I don’t see him making any big strides there in his age-32 season.

","KCP is an easy player to project because you know what you’re going to get. He’ll be returning to a Denver team that looks similar in 2022-23, although the absence of Bruce Brown makes KCP even more important to their success. 

KCP is an elite shooter which is exactly what you want when Jokic is on the floor feeding him easy looks. He hit an elite 44% on his catch-and-shoot 3s, but he’s more than just a threat from deep. In the playoffs, KCP hit 64% of his 25 mid-range attempts which was second in the NBA. Defensively, KCP posted the second highest steal rate of his career and his highest block rate, making him a no-brainer “safe” pick in the late rounds if you need efficient 3s and solid defensive stats without hurting you anywhere.",Productive 3-and-D role player with a safe floor.,SG6/SF6,0,135,163,17,25,26,135,0.444732519,-0.138981158,84,393,131,121,207,321,165,12,120,320,115,143,136,102,88,115,213,128,151,SG50/SF40,22.3184,195,21.3,203

He averaged a couple less points and rebounds per game and his block rate and free throw percentage plummeted. For his career Gobert blocks 2.6 shots per 36. Last season he was at 1.6 per 36. As for his FT%, only Giannis, Steven Adams, Nic Claxton and Aaron Gordon were a bigger negative in that category. Gobert’s ADP was 28, and while he ranked 60th in 9-cat for per-game value, he did sneak into the top 25 for those punting away FT%. 

Despite the dip in production, Gobert still has a lot to offer going into his age-31 season. Two of the top best defensive lineups by net rating included Gobert in 2022-23, he contested the 7th most shots in the NBA and he was 4th in total rebound rate. Minnesota has kept their core together for 2023-24 and they will have some momentum going into the season with a healthy Karl-Anthony Towns, an emerging superstar in Anthony Edwards and two-way dynamo Jaden McDaniels. Gobert is the anchor of this defense and is a lock for 30 minutes a night, and as long as you’re planning to punt FT%, you can’t go wrong at his projected ADP even if we only see some minor improvements in his block rate.",Block rate is trending down.

Adams pulled down a career-high 11.5 boards per game, tying Clint Capela for 2nd place in total rebound rate. His 2.3 dimes were useful, and perhaps we’ll see more of that playmaking with Ja suspended 25 games. He won’t score much, but when he does it will be on elite efficiency with 69% of his shot attempts coming from within 3 feet. The big concern with Adams is his shocking FT%, and while it’s relatively low volume, you will absolutely feel that weight on your team. If you end up grabbing a Giannis or a Zion for example, Adams isn’t the worst late-round big you can scoop up.

Still one of the most dominant offensive players in the NBA.","Giannis is a perfect example of why we shouldn’t completely rely on z-score ranks. They would have you believe that he finished 101st in 9-cat in per-game value. You would have to have the IQ of Mitch Kupchak to draft Giannis and not punt free throws, and removing that category catapults him up to 19th. That’s still bad considering his ADP was No. 3, and it doesn’t help that he appeared in just 63 games. 

Giannis averaged a career-high in points (31.1), adding 11.8 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 3.9 turnovers. He was an anchor in FG% (55.3%) on high volume with 20 shots per game, but he was the single-worst contributor to FT%, hitting 64.5% on a career-high 12 attempts per game. There’s no coming back from that. The other big concern is that he only had 0.8 steals and 0.8 blocks, his lowest average since his rookie season. For some context, he had a 1.2% steal rate and 2.4% block rate compared to his career averages of 1.7% and 3.4%. He’s exhausting so much energy on the offensive end that he’s losing a ton of fantasy appeal on the other end. 

An even bigger drawback for Giannis are the missed games. He’s played an average of 63 games over the past four seasons, with most of his DNPs being related to knee maintenance. He needed a cleanup procedure on his knee in late June, though it’s not expected to affect his status for opening night. Is he still a first-round pick? Perhaps, but he’s a difficult player to build around with low 3s, high turnovers, a horrific FT% and declining defensive activity for a player that will probably play around 60-65 games.","Defense has declined, and hasn't shown growth from the free throw line or perimeter.",PF3/C3,0,13,11,5,22,30,13,0.660428933,0.413634048,73,4,551,211,5,5,41,80,30,549,50,3,12,45,50,25,19,30,13,PF4/C4,49.089,8,56.61,2

He was the 48th best player in 9-cat on a per-game basis which was just shy of his ADP of 40, but he was 28th in totals because of his durability. 

For someone who averaged 25/4/4 on elite efficiency this rank may appear low, but his lack of steals and blocks kept him out of the top-25 conversation, similar to Jamal Murray’s stat profile. 

I think it’s fair to say that LaVine is generally undervalued by most, and a lot of that could be due to Chicago’s lack of success. He hit 54% of his shots off drives, 42% of his catch-and-shoot 3s and was in the 83rd percentile on ISOs. Basketball Index also graded him in the 98th percentile on rim shot creation. 

Chicago is returning their core for 2023-24, and LaVine is peaking going into his age-29 season. If his health cooperates and LaVine can get his steal/block rates and his 3P% closer to his career average, he may have a shot at his best ever finish in 9-cat.","Knee seemed to hold up well in 2022-23, but Bulls are not progressing.",SG4/SF4,0,45,49,,,,45,0.576077564,0.191868936,12,52,21,40,25,154,80,112,292,508,61,73,69,73,32,47,38,34,42,SG16/SF11,35.932,57,38,56

Would be a strange fit on a post-Dame rebuild. ,"Ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to introduce you to the world’s richest man. The Portland front office was out of their minds this offseason, giving Grant a 5-year, $160M contract shortly before Damian Lillard demanded a trade. The timing…

That would make me extremely anxious if I owned Grant in a fantasy league, as the tank risk would be off the charts if Dame does end up going elsewhere. I’m not trying to clown on Grant because it’s not his fault, and he’s actually a really strong role player. In fact, he ranked in the 86th percentile in transition, and that could make him a fun fit next to Scoot and Sharpe. The worry is that Grant starts to play hero ball on a post-Dame roster, as he was in the 33rd percentile on ISOs. Remember his FG% back during his Detroit days? I don’t need to see that again.

Grant’s defense usually drops off too when he’s “the man” on offense, and 0.8 steals and 0.8 blocks is pretty uninspiring for a player with his athleticism. Basketball Index graded him with a C- in Defensive Impact. If the Blazers get some clarity on their roster and Grant settles into a role that showcases his 3-point prowess and ability to run the floor, he will offer plenty of appeal right out of the gate with the red flags unlikely to surface until later down the road (tanking shenanigans etc.).

The Russell Westbrook of big men. ","Julius Randle has become the Russell Westbrook of big men, posting a 25/10/4 stat line that comes with some red flags. Randle put up a shooting line of 45/34/75, and while those aren’t atrocious by any means, they come with high volume. Defensively, it gets worse. Randle averaged a combined 0.9 steals and blocks, his lowest marks since 2017. He also turned the ball over nearly three times per game.

He ranked 71st in 9-cat per-game value which was just shy of his ADP, making a much bigger impact in the NBA as opposed to fantasy leagues. Randle will be returning to a similar situation in 2023-24 with the Knicks looking like a playoff team again, and there’s no question that he and Jalen Brunson will be the engine of the offense. Randle saw endless double teams in 2022-23 and still put up monster counting stats, solidifying himself as a force on the offensive end. Getting 4+ dimes per game from your big man is a pretty big deal too, and he’s done that in three straight seasons.

 The culture is changing in New York and Randle looks as motivated as ever entering his age-29 season. If you’re planning to punt a category or two, Randle is a relatively safe pick in the middle rounds but has too many holes in his game to sneak into early-round territory.",You almost have to punt a couple categories to optimize an otherwise elite offensive talent.,PF5,0,61,74,13,,,61,0.547307772,0.118862294,18,482,348,16,19,13,80,226,222,515,39,57,97,113,114,59,35,42,50,PF17,44.1434,15,45.16,21

His time with the Warriors has transformed him into one of the most reliable two-way wings in the NBA with Wiggins buying into his role on both ends of the floor. The 2022-23 season was a wash, however, with Wiggins playing just 31 games due to a variety of injuries and a lengthy personal absence due to some health issues with his father. 

On a per-game basis, Wiggins was excellent as the 61st best player in 9-cat, and he shot up to 45th if you punted free throws. He shoots 72% from the line for his career, so we should see a jump compared to last year. Defensively, he’s one of the NBA’s premiere wing stoppers with Basketball Index giving him an A+ in Perimeter ISO Defense and an A- in Defensive Impact. 1.4 steals and 0.8 blocks per 36 minutes gives him a really nice floor on that end.  

Wiggins was one of the worst ISO attackers last season in the 8th percentile, but he was one of the best finishers, ranking in the 78th percentile on cuts and the 97th(!) percentile off screens. With Chris Paul, Stephen Curry and Draymond Green around, Wiggins will feast on those again. And he’ll surely thrive from the 3-point line too, as he ranked in the 87th percentile on catch-and-shoot 3s. Bump him up if you’re punting FT%.

","Fueled by an insane push from the media, Embiid claimed his first MVP award in 2022-23 with the highlight being his 47-point eruption against Nikola Jokic. He managed to stay relatively healthy for the second straight season, appearing in 66 games and finishing as the No. 2 player in 9-cat for per-game value and No. 3 in totals. He scored a career-high 33.3 points per game for his second scoring title in a row with James Harden shifting into more of a pass-first player, adding 10.2 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.7 blocks, 1.0 steals and 1.0 triples while shooting 54.8% from the field and 85.7% from the line. 
 
He was second in the NBA in player efficiency rating behind Jokic, and he’ll be right back in the MVP race for his age-29 season on a roster that could look a lot different if Harden moves on.  Even though Embiid’s knee is being held together by scotch tape, he’s easily one of the most dominant players in the NBA right now and is a true fantasy monster across the board. The 76ers have dialed back the load management in recent seasons, although new coach Nick Nurse cited how he treated Kawhi in Toronto and emphasized the “season-long vision."" Nurse is also known for running most of his players into the ground, so he’ll have to find a balance. 

If Embiid can manage to stay above 65 games, he’ll justify this No. 2 overall ranking. And with Nurse’s outside-the-box thinking and willingness to experiment, maybe this will be the year that Embiid makes it past the second round of the playoffs.

Fantasy managers wanted nothing to do with him before the middle rounds for the reasons above, resulting in a bargain bin ADP of 82. His workload did go down to 26 minutes per game with Okongwu breathing down his neck, but he quietly averaged a double-double with a block per night with an elite FG% and low-volume free throws (that’s a good thing for him). 

No one will dispute that Okongwu is the future, but Capela may have what it takes to hold him off for another year. If you believe that, and I don’t think I do, he could end up being a great buy at his ADP. The trade rumors are still as rampant as ever, and it sounds like the Mavericks are one of the teams most interested. There is a case for Atlanta to hold onto him a little while longer, as he’s one of the most lethal players in the pick-and-roll and he has incredible chemistry with Trae Young. 

Capela was in the 91st percentile as a roll man in 2022-23, and he had the second highest rebound rate in the NBA.

A point guard in a center’s body with video game stats and zero red flags. ,"If there’s an argument against Nikola as the top pick, I’d love to hear it. The Joker has been the No. 1 player in 8- and 9-cat leagues for three straight seasons, both in totals and per-game value. It’s gotten to the point in which it’s almost unfair to have him on your fantasy team, and the same could be said about him in real life too as he led the NBA in both true shooting percentage and player efficiency with his first ring to show for it. 

Jokic gives you double digit dimes which is a cheat code at the center spot, double digit rebounds and roughly 25 points per game. He’ll be close to a block per game, and his steals have been through the roof in recent years with at least 1.3 per game in three straight campaigns. On top of that, you’re getting elite efficiency from the field and the free throw line on high volume, allowing you to take hits in that category elsewhere. 

He’s had no major injuries heading into his age-28 season which is unheard of in this day and age, and the Nuggets keep load management to a minimum. Jokic opted out of the World Cup to get some extra rest, so his mind and body will be fresh after a summer full of horse races in Serbia. He’ll also be returning to a similar roster, and I’m willing to bet he’ll find the same chemistry he had with Bruce Brown in Christian Braun for some easy backdoor cuts. Don’t overthink this one. With a league-leading 98 touches per game in 2022-23, Jokic is once again the top pick by a mile.",The complete fantasy big in recent memory.

And boy did he deliver in what otherwise was a disastrous year for Washington. Porzingis shook off his injury-prone label and was an incredible value at his ADP of 47, returning first-round 9-cat value (totals) and ranking 14th overall in per-game value. 

The Celtics came calling and acquired Porzingis in a three-team trade and quickly extended him for two years and $60M. Porzingis was one of 19 players in the NBA who ranked in the 85th percentile on offense and defense according to EPM (h/t NBA University), and he’ll bring some rim protection and floor spacing to the title favorites out East. The roster makeup in Boston is pretty top heavy with seven legit contributors, and Porzingis figures to see a healthy share of the frontcourt minutes with Robert Williams better suited for limited workloads and Al Horford pulling out the icy-hot for his age-37 season. 

As far as fantasy goes, the analysis is pretty simple. History tells us that he’ll find a way to get his 15 shots per night no matter who surrounds him, and this is a player who has been a second-round per-game value in five straight seasons. The catch is that prior to 2022-23, Porzingis averaged under 50 games in four straight seasons, and that doesn’t include the entire season he missed with an ACL injury. He’s been battling plantar fasciitis over the offseason, and that’s an injury that tends to linger.

I honestly want to avoid Washington as much as possible. ,"Tyus Jones played 80 games for the Grizzlies in 2022-23 and also made 20 starts with Ja Morant getting himself into all sorts of trouble. He was a 12th-round value in 9-cat in 24 minutes per game with most of his value coming from assists (5.2) and steals (1.0) while rarely turning the ball over.

His fantasy value got a boost over the offseason when a trade sent him packing to Washington. With the Wizards, Jones is likely to be starting alongside Jordan Poole with Delon Wright playing a significant role off the bench. He impressed in 22 starts with Memphis, averaging 16.4 points, 8.1 assists, 4.0 rebounds, 1.9 steals and 2.0 triples. Tyus had the best assist-to-turnover ratio in the NBA, and he thrived in transition (80th percentile). That makes him a good fit next to Poole and Kuzma. 

While there is a lot to like here, there’s also some red flags. The Wizards are likely to be one of the worst teams in the NBA, meaning there is some tank risk down the stretch. You also can’t be convinced that Tyus is the future of the PG position there, and at some point they will have to see if they can salvage Johnny Davis into an NBA player.","Will feast as Washington's starting PG, but that role won't hold for more than a year or two.",PG6,0,107,138,3,29,,107,0.473925654,-0.065405295,183,450,178,113,129,257,25,61,371,281,88,115,112,98,74,163,125,68,136,PG37,31.4082,92,29.79,112

","D’Angelo Russell began the 2022-23 season in Minnesota but was later traded to the Lakers in a move that seemed to benefit both teams. Russell’s counting stats didn’t change much with the Lakers, but his shooting efficiency began to trend up. In 17 games with the Lakers, Russell put up 17.4 points and 6.1 dimes on 48.4% from the field and 41.4% from deep. Los Angeles went 12-5 in those games, but he did cool off significantly in the playoffs just like the previous season with the Wolves.

The Lakers apparently saw enough to bring him back as their starter, and given the alternatives, it was probably the right call. Gabe Vincent was also brought in though with a $33M contract after his breakout season in Miami, and Austin Reaves should be primed for a larger role in the offense after his late-season heroics. Russell is only 27 and is coming off the best shooting season of his career, and he’s still the second best playmaker on the roster not named LeBron. Vincent and Reaves are threats to take some wind out of Russell’s sails, so he could potentially take a step back in 2023-24. ",Disappeared in the playoffs.

Would love to see KAT take defense more seriously if he wants back in the first round.","KAT came into the 2022-23 season with an ADP of 9 despite the addition of Rudy Gobert to the frontcourt, but a calf injury derailed his campaign which saw him make just 29 appearances. He ended the season ranked as the 38th best per-game contributor in 9-cat, a massive dropoff after ranking in the first round in each of his seven previous seasons. 

That was for a variety of reasons. For starters, KAT’s rebound rate dropped to 13.8% for the lowest mark of his career, and that was inevitable due to Gobert. Moving to the four also saw KAT’s block rate plummet to 1.5%, well below his career average of 3.4%. On top of that, KAT’s usage rate slipped a bit and he got a couple less shots per game, a trend that will continue with Anthony Edwards becoming the face of the franchise. 

There were some positives in 2022-23, though, as KAT showcased his playmaking ability as he recorded a career-high 4.8 dimes per night. I’m not as worried about his recent injury luck as I am about his drop in production next to Gobert and a rapidly improving Edwards, but KAT is still a second-rounder in my eyes as an elite scorer/playmaker with terrific efficiency and no punt-worthy weaknesses.

","Back in 2020, Holmes was the 33rd ranked player in 9-cat. The year before, he was 42nd. He very clearly has a fantasy-friendly game, and the Mavericks rescued him from the Kings this offseason after he was buried on their bench. There’s no telling how much he has left in the tank going into his age-30 season for a player who relies on his burst, but Dallas is a pretty sweet spot on paper. Dwight Powell is the starter right now, but he’s as uninspiring as it gets. Christian Wood is unsigned, and JaVale McGee was dumped. 

Rookie Derrick Lively has just as much of a chance to break through in Dallas, but the Mavs are built to win now and Luka would love to have a roll man of Holmes’ quality. Holmes is probably one of the players I’ll watch the most in preseason to see if there’s still something there.

","Booker continued his ascent up the NBA superstar ladder with several out-of-this-world performances, reaching 50+ points twice in 2022-23 and averaging a career-high 27.8 points on a 49/35/85 shooting line. A dropoff in efficiency from 3-point range made him a little more hesitant from deep, but he shot an absurd 55% on shots from 10-16 feet, up 8% from his career average. He didn’t live up to his ADP of 16, however, finishing 29th in per-game value in 9-cat. He appeared in only 53 games as well, missing a large chunk of action with a calf strain. 

Booker’s fantasy value may never live up to his name value, and his postseason dominance is only going to make it even more difficult after he averaged 33.7 points and 7.2 dimes on a scorching 58% shooting. The cons of Booker as a fantasy asset are low defensive numbers, as he averages 0.8 steals and 0.3 blocks for his career. And with how utterly dominant he is offensively, his 3-point output could be a little better too.

He’s still an uber-efficient source of points on high volume from the field and line, and his assist numbers could go up with more PG duties to offset the inevitable dip in usage he’s looking at with Bradley Beal replacing Chris Paul.

Spoiler alert: Neither of those things happened. Instead, Turner became a force without Domantas Sabonis in his way, showing good chemistry with Tyrese Haliburton and becoming a leader for coach Rick Carlisle. 

Injuries limited Turner to 62 games, but he was a second-round per-game value in 9-cat and finished in the third round for totals. He set career-highs in points (18.0) and rebounds (7.5) with a 54/37/78 shooting line, but his shot blocking dropped significantly. After posting a block rate above 8% in his previous two seasons, it dipped to 6.6% in 2022-23 with Turner exerting more energy on offense. That said, he’s probably due for some positive regression there. 

Going into his age-27 season, I still think he’s incredibly undervalued. Turner ranked in the 95th percentile for true shooting, he was a 96th percentile roll man (thanks Haliburton) and a 99th percentile post scorer. With a strong draft and free agency, the Pacers could be playoff bound and Turner is set up to be the anchor on defense and the third option on offense. Durability is a concern, sure, but there’s so much to like here that I can ignore it at his projected ADP. When you’re the roll man for one of the best PGs in the NBA, I want you on my fantasy team.","Thriving next to Haliburton, and the trade rumors are done.",C3,0,26,36,18,,,26,0.642252118,0.364485146,115,24,363,137,66,53,258,226,5,444,37,20,18,17,28,9,13,84,34,C9,34.8645,64,37.18,60

While most of his production was similar with a near double-double average, he saw his steal and block drop to career lows. The reason was simple, as the Bucks had a healthy Brook Lopez back in the mix which moved Portis to the four. 

For context, Portis played 81% of his minutes at the four in 2022-23 compared to the 7% the year prior. With Lopez re-signing, expect similar position splits. An area that we could see some positive regression is his 3-point shooting, as he shot 37% compared to 39% in 2021 and 47% in 2020 (career best by a mile). It’s hard to view Portis as anything more than a late-round source of points, rebounds and 3s with above average percentages and an allergy to defensive stats.","One of the best backup bigs in the NBA, but he did regress last season.",PF6/C6,0,137,186,11,28,,137,0.441738116,-0.146563922,159,139,364,121,115,22,241,313,222,320,150,132,141,137,223,105,81,107,153,PF43/C39,29.947,105,29.07,114

Coach Steve Kerr called him one of the best bigs in the NBA and Draymond said he’s the “calming force” for the Warriors. 

He generates a ton of points for Golden State with his screen setting ability, and he’s a rebounding machine, ranking 3rd in the NBA in rebound rate with 14.0 boards per 36. He’s a great rim protector and contested the 7th most shots in the NBA, although his block rate isn’t great. He’s good for a couple dimes per game too, and he should have plenty left in the tank in his age-27 season despite an alarming injury history to begin his career.

","The 2022-23 season was a wash for most of the organization due to injuries and a Miles Bridges suspension, as LaMelo Ball played 36 games and Kelly Oubre played 48. Ankle/foot issues limited Rozier to 62 appearances, but when he was out there he was forced to play hero ball with a career-high usage rate of 27%. 

His production spiked as a result with career-best marks in points (21.1) and assists (5.1), but his efficiency suffered with a shooting line of 41/32/80. He had the 5th worst FG% at the rim among drivers, the 4th worst 3P% from the corner (29%) and he was the 4th least efficient player in half court sets. I almost feel bad for him as he was thrown completely out of his comfort zone out of necessity. 

Rozier has found himself in the rumor mill quite a lot along with Gordon Hayward, but if stays in Charlotte I think a mild bounce back is on the table. LaMelo will be back to run the offense, Miles Bridges will give the Hornets a rim runner, Brandon Miller will bring some outside shooting and Mark Williams could establish himself as a dominant rim protector and roll man.

","No one has a crystal ball. If they tell you what to expect from Simmons this season they are lying to you. There’s been reports of Simmons never looking better and that he’s “as healthy as he’s ever been.” We’ve seen this movie before. Chances are, that report is coming out of Simmons’ camp. 

Will the Nets give him a chance? They’d be foolish not to, as they have nothing to lose a in the early stages of a rebuild around Mikal Bridges. Spencer Dinwiddie’s job security isn’t great by any means, and intriguing rookie Dariq Whitehead isn’t healthy yet. On paper, there’s a lot to like about Simmons’ fit in Brooklyn because he has plenty of shooters to drive and kick it out to in Mikal, Cam Johnson, Cam Thomas, DFS and Lonnie Walker. He can get you points, rebounds, assists and elite-level steals (1.8 per 36 for his career), and with 89%(!) of his shots coming from inside 10 feet, his FG% will be elite. 

Do I believe in Simmons? No I don’t. However, he’s also likely to be very cheap and I’ll happily gamble on him if I end up punting away a weakness of his such as 3-pointers and/or FT%.",Not much risk at this price.

Sabonis has basically become a poor man’s Nikola Jokic, or in other words, an All-NBA talent. He put up averages of 19.1 points, 12.3 rebounds, 7.1 assists, 0.8 steals and 0.5 blocks on 61% from the field and 74% from the line. He’s now the fourth player in history to average 19/12/7, joining Jokic, Wilt and Oscar. Pretty good company…

He was 21st in 9-cat per-game value with an ADP of 24, but he appeared in 79 games to make him the 8th ranked player in totals. He shot 71% in the restricted area 40% from mid-range, helping him rank 9th in the NBA in true shooting. The lack of defensive stats are here to stay, however, as he’s always had very low steal/block rates. But getting seven dimes from your center is such an advantage these days, and Sabonis was 17th(!) in the entire NBA in assist rate.

Buddy hit a comical 44% on pull-up 3s and 42% on catch-and-shoot 3s, all while finishing 2nd in the NBA in total 3-point makes. He also posted the second highest steal rate of his career, a solid 13% assist rate (a few dimes per night) and his highest rebound rate ever.

The Pacers are going to be deeper this season, as they added Bruce Brown and Jarace Walker. It’s also fair to expect an internal leap from Bennedict Mathurin, creating a logjam on the wings. Hield may struggle to get back to 31 minutes per game, but something in the 28 range seems reasonable.

In fact, he played in a total of 45 games with most of his absences related to a stubborn toe injury. Missed games have been a common theme for Ingram though, as he’s only eclipsed 62 games one time in his 7-year career which was his rookie season. 

Ingram posted a career-high usage rate of 30% and produced his best ever offensive season with 24.7 points and 5.8 assists on a 48/39/88 shooting line. But he was still just the 60th best player in 9-cat (per game) which was about a round shy of his ADP, as his mediocre steal/block rates, low 3-point volume and high turnovers held him back from elite status. The Pelicans needed him to be more of a playmaker in 2022-23, and much like Zion, he excelled and ranked in the 94th percentile of Basketball Index’s “Playmaking Talent.”

With Zion healthy and Dyson Daniels ready for a larger workload, we may see Ingram get fewer touches on the ball. However he could offset that slightly with more looks from deep, similar to the 2019 and 2020 seasons when he threw up six attempts per game. He’ll need to make a jump defensively to break into the elite tier of wings, and when you consider the red flags with his health, he could be a tough buy at his projected ADP with his name value being higher than his fantasy value.",Not a big fan.

Due for a bump in steals/blocks. ","After finishing 7th in 9-cat value in 2021-22, Murray’s move to Atlanta saw his per-game value drop to 34th. He did play in 74 games, however, so he wasn’t a bust by any means at his ADP of 20. Murray was able to keep his scoring at the same level with the Hawks, but he saw 15 fewer touches per game and his usage dropped by 3%. 

That resulted in a few less dimes per game. His rebounding also dropped, but that’s to be expected with Clint Capela and Onyeka Okongwu gobbling up boards. The Hawks made some changes around the edges during the offseason, most notably moving John Collins. Smaller lineups are expected, and the team is likely to push the pace which would benefit Murray and Trae. 

Coach Quin Snyder said he has a “special” connection with Murray, and while the duo of Murray and Trae looked out of sorts at times, Snyder is smart enough to make this work. The Hawks reaffirmed their confidence in Murray by giving him four more years and $120M, so we don’t have to worry about any drama there.

Not much separating him from Devin Booker territory. ,"NBA champion Jamal Murray did the unspeakable in 2022-23, returning from an ACL tear to appear in 65 games with 33 minutes a night. This wasn’t a career best season for him, but he was still outstanding as the 59th ranked player in 9-cat, well ahead of his ADP of 77. 

His defensive production slipped which was to be expected, as Murray was still getting his legs under him. The rest of his production was in line with years past, although it was exciting to see him make the leap as a playmaker with a career-best assist rate of 27.5%. But here’s where things get really interesting…

During his championship run, Murray saw the largest Increase in career PPG from Regular Season to Postseason in history according to NBA University, as he put up 26.1 points, 7.1 assists, 5.7 rebounds, 1.5 steals and 3.0 triples despite not shooting as well as he did in the regular season. Clearly healthy and ready to take that superstar leap, there’s so much to like about Murray heading into the season.","Finally healthy, Jamal leaped into superstardom during his NBA Finals run.

Capable passer too.","Jakob Poeltl started the 2022-23 campaign with the Spurs, but he was later shipped to Toronto when extension talks with San Antonio broke down. Poeltl began his NBA career in Toronto and they clearly value the big man, as they signed him to an $80M extension. The Raptors are at a crossroads after losing Fred VanVleet to Houston, and they are apparently still deciding on whether to contend or start fresh by trading away Pascal Siakam and maybe OG Anunoby. 

That means there is some tank risk for Poeltl, so we could see some late-season shenanigans from the Raptors if a rebuild is what they go for. But at least in the early going, you know what you’re going to get from Poeltl. He’s been ranked just inside the top-70 in 9-cat per-game value in two straight seasons, and he’s been durable with an average of 70 games played. 

Poeltl was 10th in the NBA in EFG%, 16th in block rate and 14th in total rebound rate. One of his best attributes is his playmaking with a strong assist rate over the past few years, and I think new coach Darko Rajakovic will further unlock his game. Poeltl will single handedly boost your FG% and hit 75% at the rim last season, and while his FT% is scary, he only averages a few attempts per game.",Toronto could be an absloute mess this season.

","Jaylen Brown produced his second best fantasy season ever at 45th overall in 9-cat in 2022-23, just shy of his ADP of 39. He set career-highs in points (26.6) and rebounds (6.9) to go with 3.5 dimes, 1.1 steals and 2.4 triples while rocking a 49/33/76 shooting line. The Celtics cleared up any speculation about his future with the richest contract in NBA history, solidifying his place as the No. 2 option beside Jayson Tatum for years to come. 

Brown was automatic from mid-range in 2022-23 with a 54% shooting clip, offsetting a slight dip in 3P%. His FT% has never been good and it’s on relatively high volume, but his biggest weakness remains his turnovers – he had 197 turnovers compared to 232 assists last season, and that ratio was somehow worse in the playoffs with his inability to dribble with his left being the main culprit. It would be huge if he made some improvement there. 

Brown’s defensive numbers are solid but not spectacular, but you can bank on him getting roughly 1.5 stocks per game. A slight dip in FG attempts could be on the cards with Kristaps Porzingis in town, but the Celtics are noticeably thinner on the wings and that could lead to more time on the ball for Brown. You pretty much know what you’re going to get from Brown, and he’s a relatively safe pick in Round 4 that can be optimized by punting FT% (punting turnovers is almost never something you should do).",Poor assist-to-turnover ratio but you know what you're getting.,SG4/SF4,0,46,41,30,,,46,0.572713261,0.18328618,12,112,401,49,16,65,86,42,154,524,46,41,66,88,44,46,66,38,41,SG17/SF12,39.133,37,43.04,29

Derrick White has already been named the starter and has the better upside. ,"Although Brogdon’s career in Boston got off to a strong start, he faded as the season dragged on and his body seemed to fail him. He suffered an injury during the playoffs that was apparently scary enough for the Clippers to avoid going through with a trade, and that right there is enough to give me some pause. Brogdon has always had red flags with his injury history, and that’s not good for someone going into his age-31 season. 

The Celtics parted ways with Marcus Smart which in theory should be good for Brogdon, but Derrick White has already been named the starting PG. The addition of Kristaps Porzingis means all of Smart’s vacated shot attempts will be accounted for as well. Brogdon still figures to be the sixth man in Boston, and he’s still effective enough in a 26-minute role to have some value. Only Stephen Curry shot a higher percentage than Brogdon on pull-up 3s, and he ranked in the 82nd percentile in the pick-and-roll. But if you do take the plunge, just understand that his best days are behind him.","Falling apart, but still projected to be Boston's sixth man.",PG6/SG6,0,106,133,12,11,,106,0.474789467,-0.063235554,159,267,50,68,100,175,97,146,222,390,104,134,126,111,89,110,96,80,117,PG36/SG41,29.1446,113,28.09,125

Coach Nick Nurse ran Siakam and several others into the ground, with the forward averaging over 37 minutes per night. Those workloads are partly to blame for the decreased output on defense, as Siakam averaged a combined 1.4 stocks with the lowest steal/block rates of his career. He was the 42nd ranked player in per-game 9-cat value which fell short of his ADP of 29, but he did play in 71 games to make up the difference. 

Nurse is now out of the picture which could mean a couple less minutes per game, but with Fred VanVleet replaced by Dennis Schroder, Siakam and Scottie Barnes suddenly have a lot more usage on their hands. In nine games without FVV in 2022-23, Siakam put up 25.7 points, 7.8 rebounds and 6.4 assists. But there are some concerns here. The Raptors are reportedly hesitant to offer Siakam a max extension, and he’s set to become a free agent in 2024. His name has constantly been in the rumor mill, but Siakam has taken it all in stride and has been working on his shooting with a Raptors assistant that was flown out to Germany. 

The uncertainty regarding his future makes me a bit uneasy, but there’s not enough risk to push him outside Round 4 or 5  in my books as he’s finished inside the top-50 in 9-cat in five straight seasons.",Sure seems like Toronto is ready to move on.

He appeared in 76 games, and while he was just a 10th-round per-game value, he was the 90th ranked player in totals.

Basketball Index graded Zubac as the 6th best rim protector in the NBA, and he contested the 4th most shot attempts in the league. But there are some red flags here. Mason Plumlee is back to steal some minutes from Zubac, and it’s no secret that the Clippers will often play small ball. In fact, I would not be surprised if Kenyon Martin Jr. got some burn there. Zubac’s usage rate of 14% was also the lowest of his career, and there’s no reason to think that’s going to go up much. He’s not exciting by any means, but he’ll still get the job done in the late rounds if you’re in need of a safe third center.

","VanVleet shook off a slow start to 2022-23 to become a dependable fantasy PG at his ADP of 27, turning in second-round per-game value and finishing 11th in total 9-cat value, buoyed by his 69 appearances. Considering how often Nick Nurse ran him into the ground with near-40 minute workloads, it’s a miracle he’s still standing. 

The Raptors were forced to let him go for nothing when Houston threw $130M at him, bringing a steadying presence to share the backcourt with Jalen Green. FVV has been a second-round value in 9-cat for three straight seasons, but my main concern is all the wear-and-tear issues that started creeping up in the last few years. Will he hold up going into his age-29 season?

What you can rely on is FVV’s scoring, playmaking and output in steals. He’s averaged at least 19 points, six assists, three triples and over 1.7 steals in three straight seasons. The bad news is that he’s an anchor on your FG%, hitting 39% from the field last season and 40% for his career. He needs to stop pretending he’s Steph and tone down the logo heat checks. Last season alone, FVV attempted 46 shots from beyond 30 feet and made 15% with a confidence level that would make even Dillon Brooks jealous. He should be able to maintain his 23% usage rate in Houston, and he does have some weapons to work with on offense to create a lot of fantasy goodness.

Fultz had the 11th best steal rate in the NBA and an above average block rate for a guard, and he averaged 2.8 deflections per 36. Not only was he a disruptor on the defensive end, but Fultz was silky smooth offensively and was able to get to the rim at will with the same athleticism we saw back in college. 

The Magic were comfortable letting Fultz run the offense with 12.0 drives per game and 66 touches per game which led the team. He flashed a little 3-point shooting towards the end of the season too, and his flashy playmaking is truly something to watch.

Fox didn’t make any massive statistical jumps, but he cleaned up his efficiency and shot 51% from the field. He finished as the 40th best 9-cat player in 2022-23, roughly 30 spots higher than he’s ever finished. He was a great buy at his ADP, because those who drafted him were likely punting away one or two of his weaknesses. 

Fox has been begged for years to play downhill and coach Brown finally made it happen, as he converted 75% of his shots at the rim. For context, that’s the same percentage as Evan Mobley and Nic Claxton. Truly unheard of for a player his size. He also shot 58% on drives, the same percentage as Zion Williamson. 

Fox made big strides from the free throw line last season at 78% on 6.0 attempts per game, so you don’t have to punt that. If he can get his steal rate back up to previous levels (1.5 per 36) and continue to terrorize defenses in the paint, Fox may be ready to make the leap into the top 25.

","With an ADP of 8.0, Tatum pretty much matched expectations in 2022-23. He was the 11th ranked player in 9-cat per-game value and 4th in totals, appearing in 74 games which is no easy task in this day and age. He even spoke out about all the load management that’s been plaguing the NBA. You love to see it. 

He averaged career-highs in points (30.1), rebounds (8.8), assists (4.6) and triples (3.2) to go with 1.1 steals and 0.7 blocks on a 46/35/85 shooting line in 37 minutes per game, making him one of the most reliable players in fantasy and super easy to build a complete roster around. The Celtics essentially swapped Marcus Smart for Kristaps Porzingis which improves the spacing up front and clears the lanes for Tatum, and Derrick White takes over starting PG duties without soaking up much usage. Tatum was 8th in the NBA in usage last season and that’s unlikely to change much. 

He’s still scratching the surface at the age of 25, he doesn’t rest and has played an average of 75.0 games over the past two seasons.

He had a shooting line of 49/39/87, ranking in the 94th percentile for true shooting and 93rd percentile in points per shot. Needless to say, he blew his ADP of 93 out of the water with a second-round finish in 9-cat (per-game). 

The question I’m seeing most often around the industry is whether or not Lauri has peaked, which is strange considering he’s entering his age-26 season. The Jazz have improved their supporting cast around him though, and the arrival of John Collins could push Lauri back to the three more often which is not ideal for his rebounding numbers – historically, Lauri’s rebounding percentage is about 5% higher when he’s at the four. His block rate doesn’t change much, however, and I don’t see any scenario in which he’s not the man on offense again. Maintaining those shooting numbers won’t be an easy task either, and I’m worried that all the hype will send his ADP through the roof, leaving little wiggle room for value.",Was the 2022-23 season his peak?,SF3/PF3,0,28,35,12,14,,28,0.633441666,0.340982617,39,247,15,21,19,36,202,226,96,466,25,44,52,42,39,14,14,25,33,SF7/PF10,40.342,32,41.49,37

He left his ADP of 25 in the dust with a rank of No. 15 in 9-cat per game value and No. 9 in totals with 68 games played. 

Playing alongside Darius Garland only made things easier for Mitchell, and he maintained a 32% usage rate and took 20 shots per game while getting to the line over five times a night. 2022-23 was the best shooting season of his career, as he hit just under 40% on his pull-up 3s. He had 13 drives per game and connected on 59% of those which is just insane. For context, that’s the exact same percentage as Giannis.

The only red flag here is Mitchell’s contract situation. He’s on the books for two more years before he can become a free agent in 2025, but there’s been a lot of media chatter that he won’t even entertain an extension in Cleveland with his eyes set on New York. Hopefully this becomes next year’s problem, because from a fantasy perspective you’re getting a 27-year-old superstar heading into his prime with an absolute monster stat profile without any of the injury baggage plaguing so many other stars.

","A long-time favorite of many in the industry, Zach Collins finally put together a healthy season in San Antonio. He played in 63 games which is a miracle by his standards, posting 13th-round 9-cat value. That rank is harsh though, as he didn’t really pick up speed until halfway through the season. He then reached his final form during the silly season, posting top-50 value in the final 20 games with 16.0 points, 7.8 rebounds, 3.7 dimes, 1.1 steals, 1.0 blocks and 1.6 triples. 

Coach Gregg Popovich clearly loves Collins and named him his starting center for the 2023-24 season before they drafted Wembanyama.

There’s no chance that Collins will offer the same upside we saw late last season due to the blatant tank, and the Spurs are now much deeper. But still, Collins should be relatively cheap in drafts and he’s clearly a valuable contributor across the board. ",Red flags upon red flags. But his production is hard to argue with.

Taylor Hendricks is the future.,"John Collins’ final season in Atlanta was a total dud with the forward just barely cracking the top-100 in 9-cat. Compare that with his previous two seasons when he posted top-50 value. Although he saw plenty of minutes, his usage rate (17%) sank to a career low and he clearly wanted to be anywhere else. And who can blame him after years of trade speculation.

The Hawks later salary dumped him for pennies on the dollar, breathing new life into Collins’ fantasy value in Utah. He figures to line up at the four alongside Lauri Markkanen at SF and Walker Kessler at center. Collins will have some stiff competition up front though, as Lauri is going to get some burn at the four and rookie Taylor Hendricks is the PF of the future. Kelly Olynyk is no pushover either and will be hard to keep out of the rotation. 

The advanced metrics don’t really favor Collins because he’s not a great 3-point shooter (29% in 2022-23), he’s a below average playmaker and has been uninspiring on defense. What he does have going for him is a terrific knack for rebounding and using his athleticism to be a solid finisher. I think he’ll be better in Utah out of the gate but I’m not completely sold on how he fits into their longtime plans which gives me pause.

","Anunoby has been asking for a larger share of the offense for years, and 2023-24 is the year he’s almost certainly going to get it. Fred VanVleet isn’t around anymore, and Pascal Siakam’s future with the Raptors is up in the air with extension talks stalling out. Anunoby could also find himself on the trade block if the Raptors want to do a complete rebuild around Scottie Barnes, but all is quiet on that front heading into opening night.

Anunoby is very good when he stays within his role, ranking in the 79th percentile in transition and shooting 37.5% from deep for his career. The bad news is that he’s shocking at ISOs (1st percentile), and his pick-and-roll ball handling is awful too (28th percentile). Things could get ugly fast unless we see massive improvement in those areas. 

We can always bank on his defense though, and in 2022-23 he averaged his highest combined steal/block rates with 1.9 steals and 0.8 blocks per 36. Those numbers helped him turn in a top-30 finish in 9-cat, and he managed to stay upright for most of the season with 67 games after playing a combined 91 games in his previous two seasons.

","Allen ranked 33rd in 9-cat for the second year in a row in 2022-23, but he took a slight step back statistically after being named to his first All-Star team the year before. He still beat his ADP of 44 by a full round though, and he was relatively durable with 68 games. 

There have been some trade rumors floating around Allen, though it’s hard to imagine they are coming out of Cleveland. The pairing of Allen and Evan Mobley can be clunky at times on offense, but defensively they are a nightmare for the opposition. Allen himself ranked 4th in the NBA in defensive rating, and although he posted the lowest block rate of his career, there is reason for optimism that he’ll bounce back in that category – he ranked 6th in the league in contested shots per game (11.1). 

Allen’s rebounding is as consistent as it gets with five straight seasons averaging 10+ boards, and he’s also an outstanding source of FG%. In fact, he’s been inside the top 10 of the NBA in true shooting for two seasons in a row. As Mobley continues to develop and inevitably takes a couple touches away from Allen, the hope is that he offsets that with better shot-blocking output. He’s not a “big name” that fantasy owners will reach for, but this is a player that is only 25 years old and as reliable as it gets as a nightly-double with an elite FG% and no punt-worthy weaknesses.

And for as dominant as he is defensively, I would love to see more blocks out of Bam.","A couple years ago, Bam was expected to become the next elite fantasy big. He’s still a dominant force, but with Miami taking the ball out of his hands more often, his assist numbers have dropped considerably. After topping out with an assist percentage of 27% in 2020-21, Bam has since posted assist rates of 17% and 15%, respectively. The arrival of Kyle Lowry is to blame, and while that fossil of a point guard has declined rapidly, playmaking remains his best attribute. 

The second concern for Bam is the declining block rate. In 2022-23, Bam only swatted 0.8 shots per 36 minutes. That’s not going to cut it. The good news is that he was able to offset that with a career-high mark at the free throw line, converting 80% of his freebies on 5.4% attempts per game. 

He’s not comfortable enough to take 3s yet, but Bam is becoming more and more involved in the offense, attempting 15 shots per game in 2022-23 and converting 54% of them. He can haul in double digit boards most nights and is easy to build around without any of the usual weaknesses you’ll find with fantasy bigs. A third round 9-cat value last season, I’m comfortable with him in that range again, and that’s despite the possibility of a Damian Lillard arrival.

White’s ADP of 141 was considerably cheaper than that of Smart and Brogdon, and he ended up as the 83rd best player in 9-cat (per-game). And because he played in all 82 games (70 of which were starts), White finished 36th in total value. 

The Celtics will look a lot different this year, as Marcus Smart and Grant Williams were sent packing with Kristaps Porzingis coming to town. Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla has already named White as his starting PG, and in 21 games without Smart in the lineup last season, White put up 15.4 points, 5.1 assists and 4.3 rebounds. 

White is the ultimate role player and excels on both ends, ranking above the 85th percentile on offense and defense in Estimated Plus-Minus which is something only 19 players in the NBA can say. He’s arguably the best shot-blocking guard in the league and has outstanding percentages, but I do wish his steal rate was a little more exciting. I love White a ton, but the problem is that almost everyone in the fantasy industry does too which could make him tough to grab. He’s likely to be a way better value in “hometown” leagues with your friends as opposed to highly competitive ones since he’s not a household name.",Boston's starting PG was one of the best shot blockers at his position in 2022-23.,PG5/SG5,0,66,108,12,5,,66,0.537968283,0.095316504,133,280,54,74,104,199,59,146,49,390,64,76,74,53,42,85,53,74,82,PG21/SG27,32.5635,80,31.1,103

Will play a hefty role under Thibs. ,"Josh Hart began the season in Portland before he was traded away to the Knicks where he was able to join forces with his Villanova teammate, Jalen Brunson. Although he was used off the bench in New York, Hart still played 30 minutes a night and averaged 10.2 points, 7.0 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 1.4 steals, 0.5 blocks and 1.1 triples on a 58/51/79 shooting line. 

Needless to say, he instantly became one of Thibodeau’s guys. With the Knicks, Hart was the 55th ranked player in 9-cat (per game), but it’s unfair to expect these percentages to hold. The Knicks are also a little deeper this season with the addition of DiVincenzo. Hart played mostly small forward with the Knicks with a handful of minutes at the four, and there’s no reason to think he won’t be in the 28-30 minute range with New York giving him a $81M contract. One of the best rebounding forwards in the NBA, Hart has also become a solid playmaker, a respectable 3-point shooter and a great source of steals with his 2.2% steal rate being the highest mark of his career.",The ultimate role player for Thibs.

Can he hit his 3s and get his block rate back up?,"Nick Nurse, a notorious Boucher hater, is finally gone. However, there’s no telling what the new regime will think of Boucher, and I’ve heard nothing but crickets out of Toronto about him. Boucher’s breakout 2020 campaign seems like a distant memory, and Boucher didn’t exactly help himself last season. His block rate tanked, and he shot below 33% from deep for the second straight season. I’m not writing him off, but he’s running out of time and the Raptors toying with the idea of a full-blown rebuild won’t help his case. Could it be Christian Koloko time instead?",,PF7,0,175,0,25,27,,175,0.398041262,-0.258420335,241,225,354,232,192,109,446,226,37,150,185,166,152,156,182,126,138,214,203,PF57,20.695,213,21.46,199

Simply will not miss games. ","There is durable, and then there’s Mikal Bridges. Thanks to an in-season trade to Brooklyn, Bridges actually played in 83 regular season games in 2022-23. In his five year career, Bridges has not missed a single game. His iron man streak even dates back to his college days at Villanova. In the era of load management, maintenance, rest and fake injuries, Mikal is the hero the fantasy community needs. 

A role player for his entire career, Bridges was moved out of his comfort zone upon joining Brooklyn and immediately turned some heads with just how skilled he truly is. He averaged 26.1 points, 4.5 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 2.5 triples, 1.0 steals and 0.6 blocks on a 47/37/89 shooting line. He was in the 80th percentile for pick-and-rolls, 82nd percentile on ISOs and 80th percentile on spot ups. The total package. 

 He produced late-2nd round value in 9-cat during his time with Brooklyn, and that’s probably the price you’ll have to pay if you want him on your team this season. The Nets are returning pretty much the same roster as last season, though a supposedly “healthy” Ben Simmons in the mix could make things interesting. If Ben does take some of the ball-handling responsibility away from Bridges, the hope here is that his steal/block rates climb back up to his previous standards.

Strictly speaking basketball, Bridges is one of the best lob threats in the NBA and has the ideal player in LaMelo Ball to set him up.

Exactly what you want from your late-rounders. ","Playing next to Nikola Jokic has it’s perks. Brown was never a good fantasy asset prior to 2022-23, but he had a career year with the Nuggets and threatened the top-100 with 10th-round value in 9-cat. Most of his value derived from his playmaking (3.4 dimes) and defensive stats (1.1 steals and 0.6 blocks) with modest 3s (1.1 3PM) on above average percentages. 

He was in the 88th percentile off screens and 71st percentile off cuts, making him an ideal role player for Jokic’s playmaking vision. Brown took a massive payday to join the Pacers where he will team up with another wizard in Tyrese Haliburton, so hopefully they can find similar chemistry. Brown will play a significant role if his salary is any indication, though I don’t think his usage will suddenly spike on the Pacers.

Elite PG, but struggles with rebounding and stocks. ","Brunson is the one who got away from Dallas, leading the Knicks on a special run (by their standards) to 47 wins and a playoff appearance. He had plenty of hype coming into the 2022-23 fantasy season with an ADP of 64, and he more than delivered as the 44th best player in 9-cat (per-game). He played in 68 total games and set multiple career-highs in points (24.0), assists (6.2), steals (0.9) and 3-pointers (2.0) with a 49/41/83 shooting line. 

His time on the ball went up 13% compared to his time with Dallas, quickly establishing himself as New York’s leader. It also speaks volumes that Brunson was named Team USA’s leader by Steve Kerr. Heading into his age-27 season, the floor general is only going to get better and that’s scary to think about. In 2022-23, Brunson was in the 82nd percentile for pick-and-rolls, 84th percentile in ISOs and 85th percentile in spot up shooting. 

Brunson has tremendous efficiency in both percentages, and while I’m very bullish on him for 2023-23, the only thing that will hold him back from elite status in fantasy is a low steal rate, low rebound rate and non-existent blocks, as his 6’1 frame and 6-4 wingspan aren’t doing him any favors.

Safe but boring fantasy center in my eyes.,"Wendell Carter Jr. continues to be more valuable on an actual NBA floor compared to fantasy world. Despite averaging 15/9/2 on 52% shooting, WCJ finished just outside the top-100 in 9-cat per-game value. A pedestrian FT% on decent volume combined with steal and block rates that would make only Blake Griffin jealous were the culprits. 0.6 steals and 0.7 blocks per 36 minutes simply isn’t going to cut it. 

The good news is that he’s a legit stretch five now, hitting a career-high 1.4 triples on a 35% clip. He’s comically good at the rim (85%) which will keep his FG% up, and going into his age-24 season, I think he’s only going to improve. The lack of defense reduces his upside considerably, but you know what you’re going to get with WCJ and he doesn’t have much competition at the five.",Lacks top-50 upside with low defensive stats.,C6,0,102,95,,,,102,0.476094532,-0.059958027,112,63,472,121,91,29,171,185,96,466,127,84,106,112,166,91,85,98,95,C33,31.7692,87,32.25,92

Now has a new weapon in Chet.,"With everyone absolutely terrified about the Thunder tanking for Wembanyama and an early season shutdown for SGA, he instead became one of the best players in the NBA and led them to a 40-win season. With an ADP of 47, he left that number in the dust on his way to a No. 3 overall finish in 9-cat with 31.4 points, 5.5 assists and 4.8 rebounds, 1.6 steals, 1.0 blocks and 0.9 triples on 51/35/91 shooting. To put his season into context, SGA joined Michael Jordan and LeBron as the only players to average 30 points, 4 rebounds, 5 assists, 1 steal and 1 block on 50% FG in history (h/t Brandon Rahbar). 

He was a wrecking ball in the paint, averaging a league-high 23.9 drives per game and getting to the charity stripe 11 times per game. He was 7th in the NBA in usage rate and in player efficiency rating, earning a spot on the All-NBA First Team. He did all of this without a reliable frontcourt partner, and now he’s going to have Chet Holmgren to work with. 

Even if SGA doesn’t match his absurd percentages and takes a small usage hit, the defensive stats are likely here to stay as he was third in the NBA in deflections per game. With OKC’s rebuilding phase coming to an end, SGA will turn this team into an absolute juggernaut in the West and could have many first-round finishes in his future at only 25 years old.","Impossible to contain on drives, and a menace on defense.",PG1/SG1,0,3,4,1,,,3,0.780443969,0.773693503,18,71,2,211,1,104,49,4,63,524,4,15,3,5,2,3,10,3,4,PG1/SG1,42.9575,17,52.28,5

Calling it a breakout season doesn’t even do it justice, as Jaren won the Defensive Player of the Year Award and was named a first-time All Star with averages of 18.6 points, 6.8 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 1.0 steals, 3.0 blocks and 1.6 triples on a 50/35/78 shooting line. The best part? He did this in 28 minutes per game. His 9.6% block rate was on a level that only Manute Bol, Serge Ibaka and Hassan Whiteside have reached, and he became the first player in history to average 3.0 blocks and 1.5 triples. A true unicorn. 

JJJ is coming into the season with a clean bill of health for once, and the Grizzlies will begin the year with Ja Morant suspended for 25 games. Dillon Brooks getting punted to Houston also leaves 45 shots on the table to be absorbed by the likes of JJJ, and you have to love that he spent the summer learning from the best of the best with Team USA. I’m expecting another leap for JJJ in his age-24 season as he stakes his claim as a top three big in fantasy basketball.",Could legitimately move into the top-5 if he takes another leap. Will only be 24 in September.,PF2/C2,0,11,9,1,9,18,11,0.731860074,0.618448322,130,104,60,113,48,63,313,80,1,444,10,7,5,4,10,2,6,55,14,PF3/C3,38.02,41,41.71,35

Elite steals and solid across the board.,"One of “my guys,” Melton built on his successful 2021-22 campaign and broke through the top-75 in 9-cat value in 2022-23 in only 27 minutes per game. He started 58 of 77 games, and every time the 76ers were without any key player, it was usually Melton who saw his value spike with his multi-position versatility – he logged minutes at three different positions. 

Melton has become a very reliable perimeter shooter, especially on his catch-and-shoot 3s (41% clip). He’s not where he needs to be as a playmaker yet and ranked in the 48th percentile as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, so there’s still a lot of room for growth there. Defensively, he’s as good as it gets. Melton had the second highest steal rate in the NBA in 2022-23, he had the sixth most deflections per 36 and averaged 0.7 blocks per 36 which is elite for a guard. 

There are a lot of questions to be answered in Philly as we wait for the James Harden situation to resolve itself, but whatever happens, Melton is sure to be undervalued in the industry like he was last season when he had an ADP of 120. He’s the ultimate glue player for any roster build, much like Robert Covington was back in the day.",Contributes across the board. Elite steals and plenty of 3-pointers.

","Considering MPJ has had three back surgeries in the past five years, it was pretty remarkable to see him make it through 62 games in 2022-23. While he didn’t have the same explosion we’ve seen in years past, MPJ was a vital part of Denver’s championship run and was automatic from deep, hitting 3.0 per game at a 41% clip. Only two players graded higher than MPJ on catch-and-shoots when accounting for difficulty of shots, and that was Klay Thompson and Luke Kennard. This is a 6-10 forward we’re talking about. 

MPJ excelled in transition (86th percentile) and off cuts (93rd percentile), and that’s one of the perks of playing alongside Jokic. MPJ’s steal and block numbers were mediocre though, and based on previous years, there is only a little room for growth. Who knows, maybe with renewed health we could see him expand his defensive game in the future. But for the immediate future, fantasy owners can expect to get a uber-efficient knockdown 3-point shooter with good rebounding and no punt-worthy flaws. And with the massive injury red flags, he should be somewhat affordable in drafts.",Injuries have zapped his athleticism.

Bigger role is not happening under Thibs. ","Mitchell Robinson played in 59 games during the 2022-23 season, missing a large chunk of them with a thumb injury. He was very effective when on the floor though, placing 50th in 9-cat per-game value in 27.0 minutes on the back of his production in rebounds (9.4), blocks (1.8) and FG% (67.1%). 

Basketball Index has a “Defensive Playmaking” metric that combines steals, deflections, blocks, and offensive fouls drawn, and Robinson placed 10th on that list last season. Robinson’s foul rate has decreased with each season as he becomes more disciplined, and while that has led to fewer blocks, he was still 6th in the NBA in block percentage. 

Robinson has some offensive tools, but the Knicks almost never let him use them. In fact, last season Robinson had six shot attempts outside the paint, making one of them. 52% of his shots were dunks which led the NBA, so that explains why he was third in the NBA in FG%. Robinson may as well shoot blindfolded from the line, but the good news is that it’s a low enough volume to not matter much. New York didn’t make too many roster decisions that will impact Robinson, so it’s pretty safe to project similar production in 2023-24. ",Hartenstein wasn't as big a threat as feared.

He also flashed some impressive playmaking ability, ranking in the 82nd percentile in the pick-and-roll. It’s difficult to gauge Simons’ value with Damian Lillard’s future in the air, and the addition of Scoot Henderson combined with some internal improvement from Shaedon Sharpe could make Simons expendable – it’s no secret that his name has been in the rumor mill.","Questionable future with Portland and lacks playmaking, but boy he can put up points with the best of them.",PG6/SG6,0,99,77,14,23,,99,0.480059965,-0.050003085,25,529,34,5,39,313,77,146,292,484,71,139,179,163,59,118,90,71,92,PG32/SG39,33.8486,72,33.47,83

Toronto could be a mess. ","Gary Trent produced the second best fantasy season of his career, appearing in 66 games and taking a slight step back in 3-pointers, steals and assists. He had a respectable 21% usage rate while turning it over just 0.8 times per game. He ranked 62nd in 9-cat (per-game value), beating his ADP by a couple rounds. 

The Raptors could look a lot different in 2023-24, as Fred VanVleet is now with the Rockets and Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby are constantly in the rumor mill with the potential for a full-blown rebuild in Toronto. Trent can’t be considered a lock to stay in Toronto either, as he’s in the final year of his deal worth $18M. There was talk of a lucrative extension offer, but there’s been crickets since. A trade wouldn’t be the worst thing for his value because the Raptors are a tank risk in 2023-24, but for the immediate future, you have to think that he’s going to get a solid chunk of VanVleet’s vacated field goal attempts. 

Trent will continue to be a great source of points and 3-pointers wherever he ends up, but his biggest appeal is his steal rate with two straight top-10 finishes in that category.

He was an 11th-round fantasy value in 9-cat in 2022-23 in 24 minutes per game, splitting his time with the Jazz and Lakers. 

Most of his value came from his rebounding, but that’s no surprise. For his career, he averages 11.5 boards per 36 minutes. He’s also an elite disruptor defensively with 1.8 steals per 36 for his career, and he’s not a bad shot blocker either (0.8 per 36). My favorite swing skill that could make Vando take the leap as a player is his playmaking ability. He’s always shown flashes in this area dating back to his Kentucky days, but he didn’t get as many chances to facilitate in Los Angeles compared to Utah. 

Offensively he’s pretty limited with 75% of his shots coming from inside of 10 feet, but at least his FG% will be high as a result. The bad news is that his workload is likely to be held in check with the Lakers, as 24 minutes is probably a fair expectation when you have LeBron (will play some 3), Anthony Davis and Rui Hachimura at your disposal. Vando isn’t for every build but you can’t go wrong if you find yourself needing rebounds, steals and FG% for cheap.","Lakers really seem to love Rui, so a 24-minute role may be Vando's ceiling this season.",PF6,0,139,132,11,25,,139,0.439112604,-0.153219465,185,59,457,345,256,51,165,42,222,320,171,123,94,93,180,123,178,109,154,PF44,24.248,173,24,175

","A walking 25/10, Trae Young’s counting stats did not suffer with the addition of Dejounte Murray in 2022-23. He was very durable for the second straight season with 73 games played, and he averaged a career-high 1.1 steals. The bad news is that Trae’s shooting went off a cliff – he shot 42% from the field and 33% from deep, and when you’re talking about 20 shots a night, that can blow up your FG%. That combined with over four turnovers per game is why Trae ranked 51st in 9-cat value compared to his ADP of 11, although that’s a bit harsh since most of his fantasy owners probably punted away one of his weaknesses.

Trae’ brutal start to the season is largely to blame, and he went through a similar shooting slump during his rookie season. He also became hesitant from beyond the arc with two less 3PAs per game. If he can get his shooting and confidence back to the level we saw in 2021-22, the narrative around Trae will quickly change. 

Trae was 4th in the NBA in assist percentage and 4th in time of possession, so he’s going to dominate the ball again on Atlanta’s revamped roster. He can also get to the line at will, ranking 6th in the NBA in FTAs and hitting them at a nearly 90% clip. It doesn’t seem like Trae will be discounted much despite coming off a down year, but anyone who can get you double digit assists while single handedly carrying you in FT% is a great snag in the second round.

Will he buy in or not?,"Deandre Ayton has been trending in the wrong direction for several years and has some of the worst body language in the NBA, often looking agitated when he’s not fed the ball despite rarely showing any effort. Without trying to be harsh, there are so many red flags here that it might play to his favor in fantasy basketball, but we’ll have to see where his ADP ends up. 

The Suns have been shopping Ayton for the past couple seasons, but they haven’t been able to find a sucker to take on his contract. They may want to try calling Charlotte or Washington’s front office. They later decided to “move forward” with Ayton as their starting center, though he’ll have to accept that he’s going to get fewer touches in a revamped offense that will revolve around Booker, Durant and Beal. 

For all his faults, Ayton still ranked 54th in 9-cat last season (per game), averaging a double-double and shooting very well from the field without tanking your FT%. But 0.8 blocks per game after swatting 0.7 per game the year before is unacceptable for a center with his size and athleticism. If you want to roll the dice on a boring center that hasn’t improved since his rookie season and that doesn’t enjoy basketball, then Ayton is your guy. ",The fourth option in Phoenix.

","Luka’s price tag was hefty in 2022-23 with an ADP of 4.0, but he fell a little short of expectations – he ranked 16th in per-game 9-cat value and 17th in totals. High turnovers are par for the course when you’re talking about a player who was 5th in the NBA in touches per game (89) and 2nd in usage rate (37%), so the better bet if you rostered Luka was punting free throws as he hit 74% on over 10 attempts per game. With FT% out of the equation, Luka was the 4th best fantasy asset in 9-cat. 

He scored a career-high 32.4 points per game, with 84.7% of his buckets being unassisted to lead the NBA… That is absolutely insane. He gave his fantasy owners almost a nightly triple-double with 8.6 rebounds and 8.0 assists, adding 1.4 steals, 0.5 blocks and 2.8 triples on 49% from the field. The late addition of Kyrie Irving had little to no impact either, with Luka averaging 40/8/7 in 16 games alongside him. 

Missed games are a concern with an average of 64 games played over the past four seasons, with a good chunk of those being maintenance related. The good news is that Luka looks to be in shape for the first time in his career for the World Cup, and that could lead to more games played and potentially a bump in FT% with improved conditioning. An improved supporting cast should make his life easier as well with less hero ball needing to be played. ",FT% and missed games are the only red flags for the most creative point forward in the NBA.,PG2,0,5,2,1,22,30,5,0.765038291,0.722603661,9,133,169,16,2,32,7,20,96,543,5,2,7,9,8,8,8,4,3,PG3,56.687,1,58.88,1

Reduced workloads may play to his favor and keep him healthy.,"Robert Williams couldn’t build on his breakout 2021-22 campaign when he took the fantasy world by storm and posted second-round value in 9-cat. He was coming off knee surgery before the start of the 2022-23 season and didn’t debut until mid-December, appearing in a total of 35 games. He was a top-70 player in 9-cat on a per-game basis in 24 minutes per night, floating in and out of the starting lineup with an extremely volatile role. 

The Celtics made a big splash during the offseason and brought in Kristaps Porzingis, but they did lose some depth in Grant Williams and Marcus Smart. Al Horford is 37, and with both he and Porzingis capable of playing the four I don’t see any reason why Williams can’t be in the 23-25 minute range. 

Finally healthy, Williams is set up to showcase what he can do in his “free safety” role. Williams was among the league leaders in loose balls recovered despite playing on one leg, and I would bet on seeing some positive regression with his steal/block rates. For his career, Williams averages 2.9 blocks and 1.3 steals per 36. With the fantasy industry worried about the arrival of Porzingis and Williams’ injury history, I think he’ll be one of the best gambles you can make in drafts at his projected ADP.",A 25-minute role probably suits his knees.

A great player to pair with guys like Giannis or Luka since you won’t be winning FT%.,"Zion remains one of the most polarizing players in the industry. In four seasons, he has played a total of 114 games. Zion missed the entire 2021-22 season with a foot injury and gained a considerable amount of weight, and while he looked much more like the Zion we saw at Duke in 2022-23, he only managed to appear in 29 games with a hamstring injury being his downfall. 

You can’t argue with his production, though. He put up averages of 26/7/5 and became a point forward for the Pelicans. And he was a stud with the ball in his hands, ranking in the 85th percentile as a pick-and-roll ball handler. You better believe he’ll be tasked with a ton of those again with the Pelicans returning the same roster. He was even better at ISOs (88th percentile), as he’s virtually impossible to stay in front of. And if you do manage to, he’ll just bulldoze you at the rim with Zion converting 71% from there. 

Zion’s steal/block rates were insane at Duke, and while he hasn’t come close to that level in the NBA, 2022-23 was a step in the right direction with 1.1 steals and 0.6 blocks.

Ja needs to find a new inner circle and can’t stay out of headlines. Will be tough to burn a mid-round pick on someone missing 25 games. ,"A 25-game suspension for Ja isn’t as bad as many feared, but who's to say that he won’t do something stupid again. Until he changes his inner circle, there are always going to be red flags here. We are going to see Ja’s ADP go all over the place depending on what your risk tolerance is, but if you’re getting him at the end of the middle rounds and possibly later, it’s all upside from there. 

Morant ranked 90th in 9-cat (per game) in 2022-23, and while his counting stats didn’t change much from his top-50 season in 2021-22, his percentages dropped by a few percent and his steal/block rate took a small hit. An in-season suspension and a couple injuries certainly didn’t help. He has some holes in his game with mediocre free throw shooting on high volume, an average FG%, low 3s and high turnovers, but he’s someone you can easily optimize with a punt or two with his absurd production in points and assists. 

On the court, Ja is still an absolute menace. He’s impossible to stay in front of with only Shai Gilgeous-Alexander averaging more points per game on drives, and Basketball Index graded him with an A+ in Finishing, Playmaking and Offensive Impact. He’s a traffic cone on defense, but occasionally he’ll use his unfair athleticism to get into passing lanes or make a chasedown block to keep his defensive stats respectable.",Great time to buy stock if you're rebuilding.,PG5,0,91,31,16,30,,91,0.495646862,-0.010911914,78,428,499,137,16,90,9,61,154,543,79,71,87,177,94,180,107,73,54,PG30,41.229,26,47.33,16

","Darius Garland survived the addition of Donovan Mitchell and kept his fantasy value afloat in 2022-23, finishing as the 46th best player in 9-cat (per-game). The previous season was his breakout campaign when he was the man in Cleveland, leading to a 37th overall finish. The arrival of Mitchell didn’t lead to much of a discount on draft day for Garland, as he had an ADP of 30. But with 69 games played, his fantasy owners had nothing to complain about. 

Garland’s usage rate was only down by 1% with Donny in town, and his production took only the slightest hit across the board. I actually think Mitchell is the ideal backcourt partner for Garland, as Garland is not ready to be a No. 1 option on offense just yet – he ranked in the 19th percentile on ISOs. However, Garland is pretty clearly a top-5 playmaker in the NBA, leading the league in assists off drives and finishing 12th in assist percentage. 

He’s also an absolute monster off the ball, producing 1.29 points per possession when moving off screens and hitting 44% of his catch-and-shoot 3s. For someone that won’t be 24 until January, these are truly incredible numbers.

The Lillard rumors are not going away though. ","Tyler Herro put together his best ever fantasy campaign in 2022-23, ranking 76th in 9-cat per-game value, essentially matching his ADP of 74. He set career-highs in 3-pointers (3.0), steals (0.8) and FT% (93%), all while averaging 20/5/4. Unlike the 2021-22 season when Herro won the Sixth Man of the Year Award, Herro moved into the starting lineup but his fantasy value barely moved. 

Herro missed 99% of Miami’s Finals run with an injury he’s since recovered from, and he’s heard his name in trade rumors on a daily basis with the Heat in full pursuit of disgruntled star Damian Lillard. If you’re wondering why a deal hasn’t been made yet, it’s because a trade package with Herro as the headliner isn’t going to cut it. Yes he’s an outstanding shooter, but he was in the 16th percentile at getting to the rim last season (h/t Cleaning the Glass) and usually ends up settling for a lot of mid-range shots. To be fair, he did hit a career-high 46% of them. 

Herro ranked in the 65th percentile as a pick-and-roll ball handler and is better suited to be a secondary creator, and his defensive output is underwhelming with 0.8 steals and 0.2 blocks per 36 minutes for his career.","Lacks early-round upside, but can shoot for days and may be asked to do more with Lowry fading.

The Rockets were one of the worst teams in the NBA, but Silas let KPJ and Jalen Green go rogue most nights without any defensive responsibility. 

KPJ posted 7th-round fantasy numbers in 9-cat and nearly cracked the top-75 with several career-highs. He had the 18th highest assist rate in the NBA, but he turned it over the 5th most in the NBA on pick-and-rolls (18%) and ranked in the 48th percentile as the ball-handler. The good news is that he was solid on ISOs (71st percentile), and he’s shown real potential off the ball with his 44% clip on catch-and-shoot 3s. 

A lot has changed in Houston with the arrivals of Fred VanVleet, Dillon Brooks and Amen Thompson, and new coach Ime Udoka is going to demand a lot more from his players on defense than Silas did.

Claxton led all Nets in fantasy value as the 24th best player in 9-cat per-game value and 15th in totals. With an ADP of 128, he was arguably the best value pick in all of fantasy basketball. 

With zero competition at center, Claxton should eclipse the 29 minutes he averaged in 2022-23, so he’ll be a lock for countless double-doubles. His 1.9 assists were a career-high, and he could take another step as a playmaker. Many seem to not know that Claxton was often used as a point center during his college days. Claxton’s FG% led the NBA, and his true shooting percentage was second only to Nikola Jokic. 

Claxton was a 90th percentile roll man, and it’ll be interesting to see if a healthy Ben Simmons makes him even more dangerous. Claxton’s defense is the big appeal here though, as he had the third highest block rate in the NBA behind JJJ and Kessler and contested the third most shots. The scary part of all this was that Claxton spent a ton of time guarding all the way out to the perimeter, defending a total of 151 ISOs, 51 more than any other player (h/t NBA University). Look for him to give JJJ a run for his money in the DPOY race once again.

He appeared in 78 games with 47 starts, posting 12th-round 9-cat value in 20.6 minutes per game.

He hit an impossible 73% of his shots from the field to lead the NBA, with 59% of his shots coming from inside 3 feet and 36% of his shot attempts coming from dunks. He had a solid block rate at 2.2 per 36, and he was decent on the boards, particularly on the offensive end. The starting role in Washington is his by default with Porzingis now in Boston, and there aren’t any legit threats to his spot unless the Wizards decide to go much smaller. He averaged 13.1 points, 8.9 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 2.0 blocks in the seven games that he eclipsed 30+ minutes in 2022-23, so there is some obvious intrigue here if you need boards, elite FG% and blocks with a small hit to your FT%.",Zero competition at center with strong block and rebounding rates.

He didn’t jump off the page statistically, but he was a monster on the defensive end.

Unfortunately, it didn’t lead to much production in steals and blocks, and that’s the same problem that other high-level defenders such as Lu Dort struggle with. 

His 3-point shooting is his bread and butter, as he hit an elite 40% on his catch-and-shoot 3s.

","A torn meniscus robbed Johnson of most of his breakout season in which he played just 42 games. Although he was dropped in a ton of leagues after his injury, he later went on a heater and found himself in an ideal situation after the Suns shipped him off to Brooklyn. 

The 52nd best player in 9-cat (per game) for the season, Johnson was even more appetizing with the Nets. He averaged 16.6 points, 4.8 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 1.4 steals and 2.3 triples. Cam didn’t even shoot the ball that well from deep with the Nets, so we could see a bump there in 2023-24. His 2.2% steal rate was the best mark of his career, and he was one of 19 players who ranked in the 85th percentile in offensive and defensive Estimated Plus-Minus. 

The Nets are not that deep either, with or without Ben Simmons, and that means Cam will be able to expand his game. With Brooklyn giving him $108M, you better believe he’ll have the greenest of lights on a team that is going to need some firepower from him and Mikal.",Didn't even shot the ball that well with the Nets. ,SF5/PF5,0,81,82,,,,81,0.50210072,0.005265748,126,397,72,49,100,161,202,42,222,281,77,102,113,81,68,61,110,61,113,SF22/PF22,28.4298,119,27.23,136

There will be a tank risk towards the end of the season. ","How bad was Jordan Poole’s 2022-23 season? The Warriors essentially salary-dumped him for a 57-year-old Chris Paul. A year prior, he was being hyped as Golden State’s successor in the backcourt. Despite averaging career-highs in points (20.4) and assists (4.5), Poole’s efficiency fell off a cliff with a shooting line of 43/33/87. 

He was in the 49th percentile in transition, 35th percentile on ISOs and 60th percentile in pick-and-rolls. Defensively, he was much worse. He may as well have been a traffic cone out there. Confidence could absolutely play a big role here though, and there were times in previous years where Poole could convince you that he’s a blossoming star. Maybe the Wizards find a way to unlock him, and he’ll certainly get his chances with him and Kyle Kuzma being the engine of the offense. 

If you find yourself going with a punt-FG% build and could use a giant splash of points, 3s and assists, Poole could be your guy.

I’d definitely look for him late if I end up with KAT.,"I absolutely love everything about Naz Reid. He came into the NBA out of shape, but now he’s a top-tier athlete. He turned a ton of heads in 2022-23, as he started to take bigs off the dribble with an array of moves, hitting nearly 77% at the rim. 

In only 18 minutes per game, Reid finished just inside the top-150 in 9-cat in punt-FT% builds. He played 79% of his minutes at the five which was a buzzkill, as I was hoping he would’ve played more PF in the absence of Karl-Anthony Towns. Minnesota is apparently very high on Naz though, giving him a $44M contract. And something that caught my attention is that during Reid’s extension conference, coach Chris Finch said that Reid will be used as a backup four and five, and he didn’t rule out Reid playing alongside KAT and Gobert. 

I like Reid quite a bit as a late-round big, and he can almost double as an insurance policy for those who have KAT or Gobert on fantasy rosters. With a per-36 stat line of 22.5 points, 11.5 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 1.5 blocks, 1.2 steals and 2.2 triples, he could be a fantasy league winner if Minnesota loses a starting big man to injury.",One of the best backup bigs in the NBA.

Give me ANT.","Availability is a skill in today’s NBA, and Edwards delivered on that front again in 2022-23 with 79 games played with 36 minutes a night. He had a ton of hype coming into the season with an ADP of 20, and while his 9-cat rank placed him in the fourth round for per-game value and 22nd overall in totals, you can’t tell me he wasn’t a reliable monster. 

He had multiple career-highs in the counting categories, and getting 1.6 steals and 0.7 blocks from a wing is pretty insane. Among all 20+ PPG scorers, Edwards was first in the NBA in combined steals and blocks. A true two-way superstar, Edwards showing that kind of defensive energy while having the 17th highest usage rate in the NBA is unheard of. 

What he’s been able to accomplish in the NBA at such a young age is scary, as he’s only going into his age-22 season. His supporting cast will be better in 2023-24 with a healthy Karl-Anthony Towns and a steadying backcourt presence in Mike Conley, along with Rudy Gobert, Jaden McDaniels and Kyle Anderson. The hope here is that Edwards gets some positive regression with his free throw shooting, and if he gets close to 80% then there is no doubt that we have a potential first-rounder on our hands. I’m buying all the Edwards shares I can get and if you ask anyone around the association who the face of this franchise is, everyone is pointing to him and not KAT for a reason.","No. 6 is higher than most other lists, but the NBA is going to be his soon.",SG3/SF3,0,12,6,1,17,,12,0.695067074,0.510264955,11,439,172,12,11,80,49,5,30,531,11,9,21,18,13,13,26,18,12,SG4/SF3,46.07,13,48.6,12

He’s on the verge of superstardom and has a better supporting cast, but his ankle has to cooperate. ","Lamelo’s glass ankle robbed us all of what should’ve been an epic season. Charlotte’s franchise player ended up playing just 36 games, a brutal blow considering he was carrying an ADP of 13. He finished 30th in per-game 9-cat value which is about a round worse than he finished in 2021-22. Even though his counting stats were up, his FG% and FT% suffered and his steal and block rates declined. 

Ball’s supporting cast was horrid in 2022-23, forcing him to often play hero ball. This time around, he’ll be getting his favorite lob target back in Miles Bridges, and Mark Williams could potentially be a monster in year two. The Hornets controversially added Brandon Miller in the draft instead of Scoot, and as big of a mistake as I think that was, it’s better for Ball’s fantasy value. 

Ball was 4th in the NBA in touches per game last season and that will likely stick, and with renewed health and a better supporting cast, I think we could see some positive regression with his steal/block rates and his shooting. More specifically, Ball shot just 31% on shots from 3-10 feet, but in his previous two seasons he was closer to 40%. There aren’t many first-round talents without injury baggage and Ball is no different, so I’ll happily roll the dice on someone who can get me 25/8/6 with a high steal rate, loads of 3-pointers and an elite FT%.","Lights out 3-point shooter and playmaker, but the ankle scares me.",PG2/SG2,0,9,8,1,5,9,9,0.739781721,0.642672608,24,524,40,1,23,65,5,5,154,550,1,8,32,6,7,16,16,7,5,PG5/SG3,54.658,2,49.49,10

Jordan Poole is in town along with Tyus Jones, while Kuzma is also back with a bloated contract. But if Avdija can’t break out on this roster, I’ll be very concerned. 

Statistically, there is definitely something there. In the 26 games that Avdija played more than 30 minutes, he averaged 14.3 points, 8.6 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.4 triples. He’s a way better defender than people give him credit for, and there’s a reason he had the 9th most difficult matchup data in the NBA according to Basketball Index.

Okongwu’s ADP was extremely low at 124, and he was super easy to grab even in competitive leagues. He ended up finishing just inside the top-75 of 9-cat leagues for per-game value, and with 80 games played, he was inside the top 50 for totals.

Capela is still around, and the trade rumors are too with the Mavericks expected to make a push. Capela has two years left on his deal, so the Hawks aren’t just going to give him away. John Collins has moved on, but that may not impact Okongwu much – Okongwu has only logged 3% of his career minutes at the four. 

I still think Okongwu will be higher ranked than Capela when all is said and done, and even if he comes off the bench again, surely he’ll at least force a timeshare? Okongwu is an elite defender, earning the nickname “Giannis stopper.” Okongwu was in the 99th percentile for post up defense, and he’s a “stocks” monster with 2.1 blocks and 1.1 steals per 36. He’s also way better on offense than people give him credit for, hitting 56% of his mid-range shots and ranking in the 91st percentile on post ups, 75th percentile as the roll man and 78th percentile in transition.

He’ll be a popular breakout pick in the middle rounds but I’ll happily pay up to grab him where I can.",Clint Capela is holding on for dear life.

Could be top-5 for the next decade.,"Everyone’s favorite breakout candidate did not disappoint, as Haliburton finished 8th in 9-cat per-game value ahead of his ADP of 14. Of course he only played 56 games, missing a chunk of games in the middle of the campaign and then missing 13 of the final 15 games for the tank. He established himself as one of the most elite PGs in fantasy basketball and is likely to stay there for the next decade. 

Haliburton led the NBA in assist percentage at a staggering 47.6% and was 14th in player efficiency rating, averaging 20.7 points, 10.4 assists, 3.7 rebounds, 1.6 steals, 0.4 blocks, 2.9 triples and 2.5 turnovers with a 49/40/87 shooting line. There’s not a single weakness here which is scary to say for a player entering his age-23 season. Only five players in the NBA finished higher in average points generated per game (PPG + points created by assists), and he had a 7.8 AST/TO ratio in the clutch last season which led the NBA. He’s also the first player in history to average 20 PPG and 10 APG while shooting 40% from deep. Baller. 

The biggest concern last season was the tank in Indiana, but now they have a much improved roster with the additions of Bruce Brown, Jarace Walker and Obi Toppin on top of some internal improvement from Bennedict Mathurin.

High ceiling on both ends of the floor and Wemby will open things up for him. ,"Now that Wemby mania is in San Antonio, a lot of casual NBA observers are about to find out just how good Vassell is. We only got a 38-game tease with Vassell in 2022-23 due to a knee issue, but he was the 75th best player in 9-cat on a per-game basis which was right in line with his ADP of 76. 

Despite playing on a bad leg, Vassell averaged multiple career highs and was “the man” in San Antonio with a 25% usage rate and nearly 16 shots per game. He feasted in transition (86th percentile), showed potential in the pick-and-roll (83rd percentile) and was unconscious with his catch-and-shoot 3s at a blistering 43%. The pick-and-roll numbers may be the most intriguing, as the Spurs are only going to up his responsibilities. 

A 6-7 wing with a massive 7-0 wingspan, Vassell uses that to his advantage defensively and averages 1.4 steals and 0.7 blocks per 36 for his career.

","Williams just turned 22 in August, yet a lot of people have seemingly written him off. I certainly believe there’s a legit player in there somewhere, and the Bulls seem to be sending that message too. In fact, GM Marc Eversley said that things are starting to “click” for Williams and that the Bulls might “have something special.” 

One of Williams’ flaws is that he tends to be shy on the court, and the Bulls continuously had to tell him to be more aggressive. We saw that change a bit when he moved to the second unit next to Coby White, but it will be interesting to see if he starts in 2023-24 or if newcomer Torrey Craig gets the nod. Either way, I think Williams gets the bulk of the minutes. He played in all 82 games last season and was a 12th-round value in 9-cat, but I still think he can improve in several areas as he gets more confident and earns a larger share of the offense. 

We’ll always be able to bank on his ability to hit 3s (41% mark for his career) and his defensive prowess with 1.1 steals and 1.1 blocks per 36, making him a great buy at his depressed ADP.","Bulls fans are running low on patience, but Pat Will has tools as an elite 3-point shooter with a strong block rate.

Is he ready to lead the backcourt? Would love to see more steals.,"Tyrese Maxey’s time is now. James Harden is trying to force his way out of Philly by taking shots at Daryl Morey after trade talks with the Clippers stalled, so the backcourt may as well be Maxey’s. A popular breakout pick in 2022-23, Maxey didn’t quite live up to his ADP of 55 as the 74th ranked player in 9-cat (per game), and it didn’t help that a small fracture in his foot cost him several weeks. Maxey’s counting stats were terrific, but a lack of steals (0.8) and blocks (0.1) severely capped his ceiling. 

But looking ahead, I’m excited to see what Maxey can do as a lead guard. He ranked in the 83rd percentile in the pick-and-roll and 93rd percentile in transition, though he does need some growth with his ISO game (43rd percentile). He’s already an elite 3-point shooter too (43%), hitting nearly 46% on his catch-and-shoot 3s. That’s ideal to surround Joel Embiid with. Maxey averaged 24.8 points, 5.4 assists and 3.8 rebounds in 13 games without Harden, so I can live with the low output in the defensive categories if we’re talking about this kind of offensive upside.",The uncomftable Harden situation is great news for one of the NBA's best transition players.,PG5/SG5,0,62,50,5,14,29,62,0.54689261,0.117814324,48,305,32,12,39,257,71,146,371,416,53,78,100,85,33,65,48,37,75,PG20/SG25,35.5392,60,34.79,74

Green finished just inside the top-250 in 9-cat last season in 25 minutes per game, but he has to make a jump in either 3-pointers (1.1) or defensive stats (0.7 steals and 0.1 blocks) to be taken seriously. He deserves more respect and touches on offense too, so maybe he’ll get them. Hew ranked in the 83rd percentile in transition, and he hit 41% of his catch-and-shoot 3s.

A disruptor on defense and rapidly improving as a shooter and cutter.,"Jaden McDaniels didn’t have the breakout season I was hoping for, or at least to the extent I was expecting. But the flashes were there and I remain incredibly intrigued about his versatile two-way game. Jaden posted 10th-round per-game value in 9-cat in 2022-23 which is about a round better than his ADP. Playing in his third season, Jaden posted multiple career-highs with a 51/39.73 shooting line. 

Despite seeing some of the toughest matchups in the NBA per Basketball Index, Jaden posted elite metrics on the perimeter and as a weak side rim protector, using his massive wingspan to vacuum shots at the rim. Jaden apparently is even taller than he was last season, and it won’t be long before his steal/block rates go nuclear. 

Offensively, Jaden stays within his role but that’s not a bad thing. He was 8th in the NBA in FG% off cuts (78%), and he’s a blossoming shooter from deep with a 38% mark on his catch-and-shoot 3s. A healthy KAT with his playmaking ability and a full season of Mike Conley will further unlock Jaden offensively. I absolutely love Jaden’s ceiling and I definitely get some Gerald Wallace vibes here.",Is somehow even tallen. 3-point shot is trending up and he's an elite disruptor on defense.,SF5/PF5,0,94,80,3,,,94,0.495091878,-0.012303148,94,101,391,113,115,175,202,80,30,370,98,80,93,79,73,67,103,131,107,SF25/PF26,26.8,137,27.19,138

","A legitimate Sixth Man of the Year candidate in 2022-23, Quickley put together his best NBA season in his third year. He averaged roughly 15/4/3 with 1.0 steal and 2.1 triples while rocking a 44/37/81 shooting line. He very nearly cracked the top-100 in 9-cat and posted 9th-round per-game value, making him a solid late-round pick with an ADP in the 140s. Playing 81 games was a huge bonus too. 

The Knicks let him do his thing when on the court, and he was almost impossible to stay in front of with his first-step quickness. He averaged 8.9 drives per game and shot them at a 54% clip, the same as LeBron. That’s 38-year-old LeBron, but still… He ranked in the 77th percentile on ISOs, 78th percentile in the pick-and-roll and 74th percentile in transition, so he was the total package with the ball in his hands. 

His perimeter shooting could use some work, but he was effective in the mid-range (career-high of 47%) and very good at the rim (63%). The addition of DiVincenzo will make the Knicks better on both ends, but I don’t think it will impact Quickley’s fantasy appeal much as he will likely reprise his Sixth Man role.

He was far from exciting with low points, 3s and minimal blocks, but he got the job done in assists and steals and was efficient for the most part. 

He ranked 16th in assist percentage and 20th in steal rate, giving him a nice floor for the future as long as the minutes are there. The Spurs brought in Cam Payne and are returning veteran Devonte’ Graham, but Jones is likely to claim the starting role. Having said that, I have my doubts that he’s the future of the position. In my eyes, I feel like he’s going to become a reliable career backup considering his limitations from the perimeter and average athleticism. 

The Spurs will have Wembanyama to play through this season, and there’s been talk of Jeremy Sochan running some offense in addition to Devin Vassell, Keldon Johnson and Malaki Branham getting plenty of time on the ball. Unless you’re desperate for assists and steals, there are far better options with more upside in Jones’ draft range.",Will probably be a career backup but he'll likely have starting duties one more season.,PG6,0,108,129,12,16,29,108,0.473708049,-0.065951928,118,288,65,300,137,223,21,33,371,406,101,126,77,92,79,171,149,69,115,PG38,29.077,116,30.17,106

Bane is more than capable of running the offense. ","Bane is coming off his second straight finish as a late third-rounder in 9-cat, this time beating his ADP of 50. However, a toe injury sidelined him for 17 straight games at the start of the season, and he ended up playing 58 total. He was very durable in his previous two seasons, so the missed games for a toe injury are something we can overlook. 

The Grizzlies pledged their commitment to Bane with a $207M contract, and he’s going to be a focal point of the offense early and often with Ja Morant sidelined for the first 25 games of the season. Bane averaged 22.1 points, 5.0 assists and 4.8 rebounds in 16 games without Ja in 2022-23, and he and Marcus Smart will share the ball-handling responsibility. 

And we know he’s up to the task. Bane was in the 69th percentile in the pick-and-roll last season, six percent higher than Ja. A career 42% shooter from deep and 88% from the line, Bane does not have any glaring statistical weaknesses and always plays under control. His name value has yet to catch up to his fantasy value, and he’s generally affordable in fantasy drafts for someone on the fast track to becoming one of the best two-way SGs in the NBA.",Has been undervalued every single year.

He finished just inside the top-200 for per-game 9-cat value despite averaging 22.1 points, 3.7 dimes, 3.7 rebounds and 2.5 triples. The SG was held back by a combined 1.0 steals and blocks while slashing a 41/33/78 shooting line on high volume. 

To be fair to Green, his head coach was clearly in over his head and the Rockets had arguably the worst roster in the NBA. Now the Rockets will have some structure with Ime Udoka at the helm, and the arrival of Fred VanVleet should settle things down in the backcourt. Amen Thompson’s addition can’t be understated either. The Rockets are likely to get blown apart on the defensive end, so they’ll have to push the pace on the other end and gain the edge there which is good news for Green. Despite all his flaws, there’s still so much to like. 

Green practically lived in the gym during the offseason by all accounts, and he’s blessed with a first step that only a handful of NBA players possess. The two big questions for Green coming into the season is whether or not his perimeter shot has improved and if he’s able to finish at the rim. Green hit 35% of his catch-and-shoot 3s, 32% on his pull-up 3s and 30% from the corner (yikes). As for his driving, Green hit 55% at the rim which is very poor (Jaden Ivey was at 54% for context), and his shot was blocked more than anyone else in the NBA. ","His game lacks peripheral stats, but he'll do well with some structure and a better supporting cast.",PG5/SG5,0,78,58,2,14,23,78,0.50387713,0.009718677,42,535,171,16,16,199,71,80,292,484,49,83,140,165,60,98,91,54,77,PG25/SG31,37.326,47,40.05,44

","Although Zion and Brandon Ingram combined to play a total of 74 games in 2022-23, Herb Jones took a step back from his rookie season in fantasy value despite seeing the same workload. He ranked just inside the top-80 as a rookie, but fell to 100th overall in 9-cat (per-game) due to a slight decrease in steals, blocks and shooting percentages. 

To be fair, his steal/block rates are still elite. He had the 6th highest steal rate in the NBA, blocked 0.8 shots per 36 and averaged the 8th most deflections per minute. Herb is a good enough 3-point shooter to keep defenses honest, but nearly 40% of his shots are coming at the rim which will keep his FG% up. The Pelicans are noticeably deeper this season with a healthy Zion, and Herb is likely to come off the bench with Trey Murphy’s shooting being a must in the starting lineup.

Lots of upside here. ,"Playing in his second season, Trey Murphy took the NBA by storm as one of the best up and coming wings. He led the Pelicans in 9-cat fantasy value, finishing 43rd in per-game value and 24th in totals, all while having a bargain-bin ADP of 138. That made him arguably the top value pick in all of fantasy basketball. 

Basketball Index graded Murphy as one of nine players 22 or younger with an A in finishing and 3-point shooting, combining his monster dunk ability with a flamethrower from beyond the arc. He was 39% on his pull-up 3s and 40% on his catch-and-shoot 3s, and that all but guarantees him a spot in the starting lineup. He’s also a stud in transition (91st percentile), and this is a New Orleans team that is built to run with Zion Williamson back in the mix. 

Murphy also offers a strong steal/block rate for a wing, but he’s not a playmaker yet with a low assist rate and he won’t get many rebounds with Valanciunas and Zion around. Considering his rank on only 10 shots a night in 2022-23, there’s no reason to think he can’t duplicate his success.",He's on his way to becoming one of the NBA's best shooters.

Already one of the best finishers in the NBA. ,"Unsurprisingly, Wagner made a leap in his second NBA season with multiple career-highs. Averaging 18/4/3 with a 48/36/84 shooting line, Wagner also hit 1.6 triples and upped his steals to 1.0 per game. 

Franz is an extremely unique player for his size, averaging 10 drives per game with finishing metrics that grade through the roof on Basketball Index. And how about this for a stat: According to NBA University, Wagner was in the 8th percentile of “rim shot quality” yet was in the 96th percentile in rim shot making. That should not be possible. Wagner also graded in the 85th percentile in transition. 

Defensively, Wagner can guard multiple positions and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if his block rate starts to climb out of the depths. While his overall rank in 9-cat wasn’t too impressive in 2022-23, I think Wagner could be an All-Star this season and that a full-on breakout is inevitable.

The Myles Turner trade that was widely expected never happened either, and instead Turner found some chemistry with Tyrese Haliburton. 

Jackson’s per-minute upside is through the roof, but his role is completely up in the air heading into camp.

Clint Capela and De’Andre Hunter are both apparently on the trade block, so a Johnson breakout is on the table in 2022-23. But as it stands, he’ll have to wait his turn as the primary backup behind Hunter. 

In the long run, there’s so much to like. Johnson is a great athlete, he can facilitate (2.9 dimes per 36), he rebounds well and offers great steal/block rates. He only has 92 games under his belt in two seasons so he's still a well-kept secret outside of hardcore leagues where he is something of a mythical creature.

His role increased as the season dragged on, and eventually Reaves was one of the most important creators on offense which earned him a $56M payday. 

The Lakers brought back D’Angelo Russell and added Gabe Vincent behind him, while Reaves is a lock to start at SG. LeBron is still fighting off Father Time somehow, but Reaves has shown that he can take some of the load off. In fact, he was a 90th percentile pick-and-roll ball handler. He was also absurd at the rim where he converted 83% of his shots. In the 27 games that Reaves played at least 30 minutes, Reaves averaged 16.1 points, 4.3 assists, 3.5 rebounds, 0.5 steals, 0.3 blocks and 1.3 triples with insane efficiency.

Lots of holes in his stat profile, but the Raptors are now his with FVV gone. ","Expectations were through the roof for Barnes after his Rookie of the Year campaign in 2021-22, resulting in an ADP of 44. Unfortunately, he finished nowhere close to that, ranking 82nd in per-game 9-cat value despite seeing 35 minutes a night. 

His counting stats barely moved at all compared to his rookie season apart from a slight bump in dimes, although his efficiency completely tanked with a 45/28/77 shooting line. Barnes hit 29% of his mid-range attempts and 36% on long twos, so he was a total zero outside the paint. Toronto fans calling him the next LeBron probably need to take a step back. 

He was 30th percentile on ISOs, 24th percentile in transition and 18th percentile as the pick-and-roll ball handler. I’m not writing him off by any means, and the Raptors have pretty much handed him the keys with Fred VanVleet in Houston and Pascal Siakam on the trade block, but there are a lot of red flags with Barnes’ stat profile. His ADP will likely be outside my comfort zone, but Barnes’ athleticism and power means he has the potential to prove me wrong. ","Toronto is now built around Scottie, for better or worse.

Should thrive in the pick-and-roll with FVV. ,"Baby Jokic is already one of the most exciting young big men in the NBA. He began the season off the bench because coach Silas had no clue what he was doing, but Sengun eventually started 72 of 75 games and put up seventh-round 9-cat value (per game) in just under 29 minutes a night. 

His defense became a meme on Twitter, but Houston as a whole didn’t bring any effort on that end. Silas was later held accountable and was let go in favor of Ime Udoka. Udoka is a defensive mastermind, and he’s already stated that he’ll be minimizing his drop coverages and maximizing his switching opportunities which better suits Sengun. Offensively, Udoka has big plans for Sengun as well, as he noted that he’ll have Sengun initiate a lot of the offense while adding that the Jokic comparisons are there for a reason. 37% of Senguns’s dimes were at the rim last season which is elite, so yeah I think he’s ready for it. 

The additions of Fred VanVleet and Amen Thompson immediately makes the Rockets more competitive and that’s a good thing for Sengun, and the fact that they striked out on Brook Lopez means he doesn’t have much in the way of competition.

Scary. Needs to clean up his percentages a bit more.","Josh Giddey’s counting stats in his second NBA season were similar to his rookie year, although he made a considerable jump as a scorer while increasing his percentages with a 48/32/73 shooting line. He shot 4% better on drives than he did as a rookie, he shot 64% at the rim and improved his mid-range game by a couple percent. His 3-point game is also on the verge of becoming respectable. 

Giddey only ranked in the 38th percentile in pick-and-rolls and 32nd percentile in transition, both of which should improve rapidly. The former mainly because of the addition of Chet Holmgren to arguably the best young core in the NBA. His shot chart is a little wild because he’s automatic going right but woefully dreadful going left, so there’s a ton of room for improvement. 

He’s already one of the best playmakers in the NBA, earning an A+ in Basketball Index’s “Playmaking Talent” metric. He also hauls in rebounds because of his size and strength, and defensively he’s starting to become more engaged. He has some holes in his game, but Giddey is a candidate to be the Most Improved Player of the Year Award and is a player I’ll be targeting aggressively, especially when I’m punting some categories.

Has been a zero on offense. ,"The 5th overall pick from the 2021 Draft, Jalen Suggs has hardly been impressive during his first two seasons. Injuries haven’t helped with a combined 101 games, but he has struggled to score and create at the NBA level. He had a 41/32/72 shooting line in 2022-23 compared to 36/21/77 as a rookie, so while there is some improvement here, he’s still miles away from where he needs to be. 

The advanced metrics don’t seem to like him either. He ranked in the 20th percentile in transition and 20th percentile on ISOs. Where he does excel is on the defensive end, often guarding the best opposing player. He offers great steal/block rates, so I wouldn’t write him off completely for that reason.

Efficiency, 3-point shooting and defensive output must improve to justify where he’s going.","A 10-minute scrimmage against Team USA seemingly moved Cade’s ADP up by a couple rounds in early August. Fantasy owners are taking that scrimmage more seriously than Cade’s 12-game sample size in 2022-23 due to a shin injury that ended his season in November. He put up 19.9 points, 6.2 rebounds and 6.0 assists, but he was lacking in peripheral stats with 1.4 triples, 0.8 steals and 0.6 blocks on a 41/27/85 shooting line. Putting the missed games aside for a moment, Cade had an ADP of 32 yet was well outside the top-100 in 9-cat per-game value. 

His shooting struggles are nothing new, though. During his rookie season, Cade hit 31% from deep, and that includes a 30% clip on “wide open” attempts. And for his career, Cade is just 42% from mid-range. Shooting red flags aside, Cade is still an elite playmaker with a 29% assist percentage and he was in the 70th percentile in the pick-and-roll. He’ll have one of the best young roll men in the NBA in Jalen Duren, and the Pistons finally have some shooting in Joe Harris and Bogdanovic. Rookie Ausar Thompson will immediately make things easier for Detroit on both ends as well, and new coach Monty Williams will be a massive upgrade over Dwane Casey. 

Cade is also a way better defender then his steal/block rates in 2022-23 suggested, and based on his rookie marks, some positive regression is expected there with Cade healthier and more muscular. I am expecting Cade to make a big jump during his third season, but the hype train might get out of control at the expense of his ADP. ",Stood out against Team USA.

","Evan Mobley had sky-high expectations for his second season with an ADP of 40, but he just missed the mark as the 51st best player in 9-cat (per-game). He made up for it by playing in 79 games though, providing solid counting stats everywhere but the 3-point line. His 67% mark from the foul line is disappointing, but he has good mechanics and I can see him taking a leap there. 

Defensively, the Cavaliers had the best rating in the entire NBA thanks to Mobley and Jarrett Allen, and while I expect Mobley’s block rate to improve rapidly later in his career when he becomes the full time center, I still expect to see a small bump in blocks next season – he was 4th in the NBA in shot contests per game (12.4). Offensively, Mobley has a long way to go. He was in the 45th percentile in the pick-and-roll, 4th percentile on spot ups, 6th percentile in ISOs and 16th percentile on post ups. Yikes. 

There’s zero reason to panic for a player going into his age-22 season, especially when we’re talking about a DPOY candidate. I expect him to improve rapidly on offense, and in the meantime, at least he can continue to be a playmaker with a very solid assist rate.","DPOY candidate for the next decade, but his scoring ability is underwhelming so far.",PF4/C4,0,33,19,18,22,,33,0.612727031,0.286433736,39,31,521,324,75,25,114,146,9,433,47,17,15,25,53,27,22,81,47,PF12/C11,37.042,49,40.61,42

How soon they make the change remains to be seen, but I’m betting on it being sooner rather than later. But let me be clear. You may be better off just picking Dyson off the waiver wire later on if you don’t want to burn a pick. A strong preseason could certainly change that, so be ready to act quickly if that’s the case. 

In the seven games that Dyson played more than 30 minutes, he averaged 8.2 points, 6.2 assists, 5.2 rebounds and 1.0 steals. He uses his 6-7 frame and 6-11 wingspan to generate loads of steals and blocks, and he also averaged 3.1 deflections per 36.

","Scoot Henderson is one of the hardest players to project heading into early September while we wait for clarity on Damian Lillard. Scoot will either be mentored by Dame in a backup role out of the gate or thrown into the fire as the starting PG if a trade finally happens. 

Scoot is a 99th percentile athlete built in the mold of a young Derrick Rose. He has a massive frame for a PG and a 6-9 wingspan which could make him a monster on the defensive end in the future. Offensively, he’s impossible to stay in front of and he’s developing a really strong pull-up game, but he’s not quite ready to stretch it out to 3-point land yet. Drafting rookie point guards in fantasy almost never works out. It just doesn’t.

","As is usually the case with rookie PGs, Jaden Ivey finished nowhere close to his ADP of 133, finishing outside the top-250 in per-game 9-cat value. Punting FG% (his worst category) would’ve gotten him closer to the top-200, but there were a lot of holes in his stat profile. 

A combined 1.0 steals and blocks in 31 minutes per game was pretty sad, especially for someone as athletic as Ivey. He shot 58% at the rim, 33% at close range (3-10 feet) and 40% at mid-range (10-16 feet). His inability to finish well is a red flag, and he had his shot swatted 87 times which is the 6th most in the NBA. 

He did show some promise from the perimeter, hitting 37% of his catch-and-shoot 3s. That’s going to be really important considering the ball is going to be in a healthy Cade Cunningham’s hands this season. Rookie Ausar Thompson will soak up some time on the ball as well.

He had a pedestrian 42/29/73 shooting line with 2.8 turnovers per game. To be fair, the Magic were laughably bad and the coaching staff threw him to the wolves and let him learn on the fly. 

Although he struggled at times, Paolo showed a ton of promise in the pick-and-roll and ran nearly five of them per game. His handle for his size is truly unique, and he projects to be a scorer from all three levels in the near future.

His shot has made strides and the Rockets have a new coach and improved supporting cast. ,"With an ADP of 101, Jabari Smith Jr. couldn’t reach that level as a rookie and even found himself dropped to the waiver wire in a lot of leagues. He posted 12th-round value in 9-cat, mainly because of some poor shooting (particularly from 3) and underwhelming defensive numbers. 

Smith hit 29% of his catch-and-shoot 3s, was rarely used in the pick-and-roll and ranked in the 30th percentile on spot ups. Now for the good news. In the final 17 games of the season, things started to click for Jabari and he posted 6th-round value with 16.4 points, 8.2 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 1.0 blocks, 0.8 steals and 1.5 triples. He carried that momentum into the Summer League where he was one of the best players in Vegas, and the Rockets brought him a strong supporting cast that includes Fred VanVleet and Amen Thompson. 

The Rockets will hopefully have some structure under new coach Ime Udoka, and Jabari looks poised to make a big leap in year two. He won’t have to carry the load offensively with Dillon Brooks hijacking shots and FVV running the show, but that may actually benefit Jabari since he’ll be able to get cleaner and more efficient looks.

From a statistical standpoint, it’s scary how good this kid could be right away, and he’ll have a high floor immediately with his No. 1 skill being shot-blocking. He averaged 3.7 blocks in 26 minutes at Gonzaga, and then he swatted 3.5 shots during the Summer League. He should be better than he showed at Gonzaga from the free throw line (71%), and we know he can step out and hit the 3 (39% from the college line). He’s also a capable playmaker from the post, and that will be important on an OKC team that has elite slashers in SGA, Jalen Williams, Josh Giddey and Lu Dort.

Mathurin has holes in his game but he’s got All-Star potential down the road. ,"Bennedict Mathurin had much more buzz during his rookie season than his fantasy rank suggested, as he placed outside the top-200 in 9-cat. Although his counting stats were solid as a rookie, he struggled shooting the ball (42%) and had dreadful defensive stats. 

Mathuin hit 30% of his catch-and-shoot 3s and 34% on pull-up 3s, and he was just as bad on his 2-point jumpers. He also struggled on drives, ranking 10th worst among high-volume drivers in FG% at the rim while getting blocked the 8th most in the NBA. He was solid in transition though, and he showed at least some promise in the pick-and-roll. Mathurin passes the eye test with flying colors, and there’s clearly a ton of raw talent there. The Pacers will be deeper this season with Bruce Brown, Jarace Walker and Obi Toppin around, but Mathurin figures to play a significant role in his second season. 

I have a strong feeling that he’ll be a popular late-round pick for his upside, and you have to love players that can already get to the rim at will like he can.

He has another gear to hit on the end too. ","The Summer League sensation didn’t generate any headlines during the regular season, but he was instrumental in Sacramento’s triumphant return to the playoffs. He understood his role on both ends of the floor as a rookie and rarely stepped out of his comfort zone with a usage rate clocking in at 15.8%. 

This might be good news for Murray’s ADP though, as he may fly completely under the radar. Murray was quietly one of the best 3-point shooters in the NBA as a rookie, hitting 41% on catch-and-shoot 3s at an insane volume. He was also 7th in zero-dribble 3PAs, also called the “Klay Thompson,” hitting them at a 41% clip also. 

His steal/block rates as a rookie weren’t great, but they weren’t bad either. He was a stud in those areas during college, so I think there’s a lot of room for growth there. 

The rotation for the Kings looks pretty much the same, but I think Murray is going to have a license to expand his game a bit more in year two.

Saddiq Bey and De’Andre Hunter are standing in Griffin’s way, sadly, and while I’m confident in saying that Griffin is the best of the three, coach Quin Snyder may not feel that way out of the gate in 2023-24.

","If Youtube highlights were a category, then Sharpe would be the first pick in fantasy. He is legitimately one of the best athletes I’ve ever seen, and he apparently recorded a video of himself achieving a 49-inch vertical jump. That would beat Keon Johnson’s NBA record of 48. 

Sharpe’s role as a rookie was all over the place, but the flashes were eye opening. It felt like he was able to dunk when and wherever he wanted, and that helped him shoot 71% at the rim. Sharpe’s close- and mid-range game were rough, but he showed a ton of promise from beyond the arc. He shot 45% on his catch-and-shoot 3s, but his pull-up game (25% from 3) could use work. 

He’s not ready to be a top option on offense yet, as he had very poor metrics on ISOs, in transition and as the primary ball-handler in the pick-and-roll. Sharpe’s block rate (0.5 per 36 minutes) is promising, and I think his steal rate should improve as well after he underwhelmed in that area as a rookie. 

He played 30+ minutes 10 times as a rookie and posted gaudy stats of 22.4 points, 5.4 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 0.9 steals and 3.0 triples, but keep in mind it happened during one of the most egregious tanks we’ve ever seen.

A far superior prospect than Wiseman, and Monty will get the best out of him. Now has Cade setting him up.","I leaned forward in my chair for this one. Duren is one of my favorite young bigs in the NBA and I wanted to throw my chair when my hometown Hornets traded him away. Still only 19 years old, Duren is already one of the most physically imposing centers in the NBA. He had the 5th best offensive rebound rate as a rookie and was 7th in total rebound rate. He was 18th in offensive rating and cleaned up around the rim at a 74% clip. Only Mitchell Robinson had more of his shot attempts from dunks than Duren (42%), so that explains why his 64% mark from the field was so juicy. 

Duren ranked in the 71st percentile as the roll man, and now he’s going to have a healthy Cade Cunningham, an improved Jaden Ivey and rookie Ausar Thompson to set him up. His FT% is pretty bad, but he’ll be on low volume early on in his career until he develops a post game. His block rate (1.3 per 36 minutes) was also a bit underwhelming considering his size, but his college production gives me hope on that front. 

New coach Monty Williams should fall in love with this kid, unlike Dwane Casey who favored James Wiseman. The frontcourt is a bit of a mess with Wiseman, Isaiah Stewart and Marvin Bagley, but Duren is the future and I don’t see how Monty can mess this up.

Coach Silas has been removed thankfully, and coach Ime Udoka will instantly fall in love with this guy. At least, that’s the hope. There are a lot of obstacles in Eason’s way however, as the front office had one too many drinks and handed Dillon Brooks an $86M contract. They did make the right call in bringing in Amen Thompson and Cam Whitmore, but Eason figures to get most of his minutes as a backup four behind Jabari Smith Jr. 

Maybe we see Jabari get some more run at the five after playing 12% of his minutes there as a rookie, as that could be a way to get Eason more burn. The advanced stats absolutely love this kid, as he had the 13th best offensive rebound rate in the NBA. He disrupts everything on the defensive end, finishing 5th in steal rate and recovering the 3rd most loose balls per minute behind only Paul Reed and T.J. McConnell. He also swatted 1.0 shot per 36 minutes and hit a respectable 34% from deep as a rookie. He’s generally going to be a low-usage player early in his career, but that’s exactly what the Rockets need with their current roster. If Eason can get his workload up to the high 20s, the upside will be massive.

LaMelo will feed him endless easy looks. ,"Coach Steve Clifford wasted half of Mark Williams’ rookie season in order to let Mason Plumlee shoot off-balanced floaters with his weaker left hand. So you have to take Williams’ 9-cat season rank with a grain of salt. 

As a starter, Mark showed considerable upside with averages of 11.6 points, 9.8 rebounds, 0.6 dimes and 1.1 blocks in 26 minutes per game. He’s absolutely massive at 7-0 with a 7-7 wingspan, and that’s going to make him a laughably good lob target for a healthy LaMelo Ball. Don’t underestimate that combo. 

Mark is already one of the best rebounders in the NBA, especially on the offensive glass with 4.0 ORBs per 36. His block rate is excellent and only going to get better, and his below average FT% is too low volume to worry about. He’s healthy after offseason thumb surgery and is the clear cut favorite to start at center with Plumlee out of the picture. He’s a no-brainer upside pick in the middle rounds.

On the path to becoming a two-way stud. ","I absolutely love Sochan and this is a player who definitely passes the eye test. However, he’s beyond raw as a prospect, and while I think he has a great chance to start at SF with Keldon coming off the bench, I think he’s going to have a rollercoaster of a season. 

This is a player who is still figuring out his role on the offensive end. The Spurs let him dabble in the pick-and-roll for a couple possessions per game which is encouraging, but he also ranked in the 18th percentile on those. Long way to go. He also ranked in the 16th percentile in transition, an area he should honestly thrive in. It’s not all bad though. Sochan was in the 79th percentile off cuts, and you better believe Wemby will be able to find him at will. 

The shooting percentages are what worry me the most, but if you’re punting 3s or FT%, Sochan could be worth a gamble at a cheap price as a defensive menace (1.1 steals and 0.6 blocks per 36), an improving playmaker and excellent rebounder.

A 6’5 wing with unheard of strength and a ludicrous 7’2 wingspan, Williams averaged 1.4 steals and 0.5 blocks, often guarding the best player on the other team. 

Williams shot 73% at the rim and can finish with the best of them – only Paolo took more shots in the restricted area among the rookie class. With a true shooting percentage of 58%, his efficiency as a rookie is extremely rare and his numbers after the All-Star break were electrifying with 18.6 points, 5.4 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 1.7 steals and 1.2 triples. In that span, Jalen was the 22nd ranked player in 9-cat. 

He’s also as versatile as it gets with minutes logged at every position outside of center, and he’ll likely start at the four alongside Chet Holmgren. The Thunder are going to be of the most exciting teams to watch and are likely playoff bound. Jalen will not be cheap in competitive drafts but I’ll make it a priority to grab some shares of one of the most exciting up-and-coming wings. ",Built like rookie-season Tyreke Evans.

Rudy Gobert 2.0?,"Kessler is coming off a dominant rookie season in 2022-23, but it took a while to get there. He began the season coming off the bench, but he took over the starting role within a couple months and never looked back, ultimately turning in a top-55 campaign in 9-cat per-game value. With an ADP of 141, he went undrafted in quite a few leagues and was one of the best values of the season. 

Only Jaren Jackson Jr. had a better block rate than Kessler, and he was the fourth best offensive rebounder in the NBA. He can’t do much offensively yet, but he lives around the rim and shot 72% from the field as a result. His 51% free throw rate is a red flag, but luckily he’s not going to get to the line much. 

Basketball Index has a “LEBRON” metric that estimates how many points better or worse a player is worth compared to league average, and Kessler has the highest rookie rating out of anyone over the past five seasons. Only 22 years old, Kessler is the next Rudy Gobert and it’s going to be exciting to see what he can do with a larger workload after seeing 23.0 minutes per game last season. The addition of John Collins shouldn’t be an issue for Kessler, and his stint with Team USA during the summer is only going to speed up his development.","Very little offense, but who cares when you're among the leaders in rebounds, blocks and FG%.",C4,0,37,44,2,18,27,37,0.61061844,0.280931265,203,8,541,410,154,16,313,366,1,245,74,12,14,12,62,15,11,175,62,C13,33.0206,75,35.15,70

Big season is coming. ,"All of Denver’s beat reporters seem to think that Christaun Braun is the guy who will step up in Bruce Brown’s absence. And that definitely makes sense, as Braun was one of Denver’s best defenders last season and he always brought energy to the floor. He also thrived off cuts (93rd percentile), an important skill to have when playing alongside the best playmaker in the NBA. We didn’t get to see Braun do much offensively with a 13% usage rate, but he’s going to get his chances in 2023-24.

Insane block rate and playmaking ability will give him a high floor. ","Wemby was arguably the most hyped NBA prospect ever, and personally I’ve been hooked ever since I saw a video of him at age 16 giving Rudy Gobert the business in a 2 vs 2 drill. A rare combination of size (7-4) and fluidity, Wemby will come to the league with an NBA-ready frame and is already miles ahead of where Giannis was when he came to the states. Wemby has already shown that he can play at a high level against legit competition in France’s first division, averaging 20.9 points on 47/27/82 shooting with 10.3 rebounds, 2.4 dimes and 3.0 blocks. 

Although he was tabbed as the likely No. 1 pick for years, he further cemented his case when he ran circles around Chet Holmgren at the U19 World Cup. Wemby’s Summer League opener was shaky due to nerves, and it didn’t help that the Hornets blitzed him with double teams at every chance. He found his groove in the second game though, giving everyone a taste of just how special he is. 

The Spurs are going to throw him into the fire as their No. 1 option right out of the gate, and they will be deploying him at the four beside Zach Collins. He doesn’t have any medical red flags to speak of, although the Spurs may handle him with kid gloves. I don’t often target rookies aggressively, but at least in early drafts, I’ve seen him go in the third round and I’ll bite at that price all day.","No. 3 ranking before playing an NBA game is bold, but he's a true alien on the court.",PF3/C3,0,25,3,10,18,,25,0.642908168,0.366243128,466,384,332,164,74,33,185,185,3,433,18,21,17,14,35,12,15,113,36,PF9/C8,37.496,43,40.26,43

","I hated the Miller pick for Charlotte and that is no secret, as I don’t think he’s a ceiling raiser like Scoot or the Thompson twins. But it is what it is. Miller has a great chance to start on opening night with Miles Bridges suspended, PJ Washington unsigned and Gordon Hayward trending down, and on paper he’ll provide floor spacing for LaMelo. But the game isn’t played on paper, and Miller has been ice cold from beyond the arc since the last couple months of the NCAA season. 

For a player that lacks burst and strength, that’s a red flag. Miller does have some defensive tools with decent steal rates and an ability to block shots, but his playmaking in the Summer League wasn’t as good as advertised. He ranks in this spot based on opportunity alone, though I don’t think I’ll take the plunge. ",Looked like a deer in headlights at the Summer League.

The good news is that I’m not convinced Collins is the long-term answer in Utah, and I’m betting that Danny Ainge took a flier on him to flip him in a future deal after he salvages his market value. 

Hendricks could be Jaden McDaniels 2.0, as he enters the NBA with a much better 3-point shot than Jaden had early on. He has an NBA-ready frame, and he’s an elite weakside shot blocker. Although he’ll have to work for his minutes early on, the Jazz will eventually find a way to get him more minutes when they see how dominant he is defensively.

He’ll be competing with new addition Obi Toppin, and going into training camp it’s anyone’s battle. That throws both of these guys into flier territory. 

Rick Carlisle is going to fall in love with Walker, as he plays within his role on offense as a screen setter and playmaker. Defensively, he’ll be a dynamo from day one as he can switch onto any position while offering solid defensive stats (1.0 steals and 1.3 blocks in 27 minutes during college). 

Walker put up solid counting stats during the Summer League with 14.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 1.3 blocks and 1.3 steals, but he shot the ball very poorly from the field and line.
